<h4>Wordler<a name="6821f7b2-f8a0-477b-af1a-90e617842627"></a>
</h4>
<p>Making a move in <i>Wordle</i> involves two tasks. First, thinking of the words that can be played, and second, deciding which of them to play. I like to make all the key decisions myself, so my assistant does not actually play <i>Wordle</i>. When I ask Wordler for help, she just lists all the words that could be played. It is up to me to choose one.</p>

<h4>Wordler's Vocabulary<a name="b9e94f76-063d-490c-baa5-ac3dbd89860f"></a>
</h4>
<p>Wordler's vocabulary is a hidden list of 2315 five-letter English words that are the possible solutions. The letter frequencies in this list are not the same as in English itself. For example, English has many five-letter words ending in S, but most of them are plural nouns and third-person singular verbs. The vocabulary does not have any of these. <i>Wordle</i> words end in S less than 2% of the time, compared to 31% of the time with the full set of five-letter words.</p>

<p>Here is a portion of the vocabulary.</p>

<pre class="codeinput">dbtype<span class="string">vocabulary</span><span class="string">1:9</span>dbtype<span class="string">vocabulary</span><span class="string">291:295</span>

</pre>
<h4>Word One<a name="d3faa9b1-8bcf-48d5-b799-d734e407e76c"></a>
</h4>
<p>I always start with the word LEAST. It contains two popular vowels, and I like to use mathematical and other technical words. On July 25, a gold E from the <i>Times</i> tells me that the answer has an E somewhere, but not in slot number 2. The remaining letters are black, so today's answer does not have any L, A, S or T.</p>

<p>(If I were to ask Wordler for assistance with the first word, she would just reply with all 2315 words she knows.)</p>

<p>
<img alt="" hspace="5" src="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Wordler01.png" vspace="5" /> </p>

<h4>Word Two<a name="e7c96b4b-26c7-4362-991f-f89625e418e4"></a>
</h4>
<p>For the second word, I chose PHONE. It has the required E, as well as another popular vowel. It gets a gold O to go with the gold E.</p>

<p>(Wordler's suggestion in this situation would have been the 268 words containing an E in any slot except the second. That's not much help.)</p>

<p>
<img alt="" hspace="5" src="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Wordler02.png" vspace="5" /> </p>

<h4>Word Three<a name="ecbedb8e-b368-424c-845c-13a8ffa38ca6"></a>
</h4>
<p>I know now that I am seeking a word with an E in any slot except 2 or 5, an O in any slot except 3, and no L, A, S, T, P, H or N. I decided to try COVER and am rewarded with three green letters.</p>

<p>(Wordler knows 23 words meeting the requirements.)</p>

<p>
<img alt="" hspace="5" src="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Wordler03.png" vspace="5" /> </p>

<h4>Word Four<a name="4ae0c571-eeb1-4f98-a47c-b695cf181456"></a>
</h4>
<p>Here, for the first time, I decided to ask Wordler. I press the <tt>Words</tt> button and get some bad news. She tells me she knows seven possible words.</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li>BOXER</li>
<li>FOYER</li>
<li>JOKER</li>
<li>MOWER</li>
<li>ROGER</li>
<li>ROWER</li>
<li>WOOER</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>I have only three guesses remaining. My odds of winning are less than 50-50. I chose MOWER because, if it is not correct, the three words containing W would be eliminated.</p>

<p>
<img alt="" hspace="5" src="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Wordler04.png" vspace="5" /> </p>

<h4>Word Five<a name="bb6699b4-4722-41fc-a429-cec8fa1ce44e"></a>
</h4>
<p>Getting worried, I chose ROGER because it has two Rs. Again, not much luck.</p>

<p>
<img alt="" hspace="5" src="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Wordler05.png" vspace="5" /> </p>

<h4>Word Six<a name="f48e61e4-4b42-48a7-865f-a8de79008a6a"></a>
</h4>
<p>This is my last chance and there are still three words remaining.</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li>BOXER</li>
<li>FOYER</li>
<li>JOKER</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Which would <i>you</i> choose?</p>

<p>I chose JOKER and strike out.</p>

<p>
<img alt="" hspace="5" src="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Wordler06.png" vspace="5" /> </p>

<h4>Final Word<a name="ec08f35c-412c-40b0-aa08-ef088e160836"></a>
</h4>
<p>If you happen to have played puzzle number 1497, you realize that Wordler is missing at least one word from her vocabulary. The word that tripped up so many last week is GOFER, which neither I nor my assistant thought of.</p>

<p>(Ever-helpful Google informs us that a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gofer">GOFER</a> is "a person who runs errands, especially on a movie set or in an office.")</p>

<h4>Software<a name="d2350965-9e73-48bc-a9a9-5745e964f356"></a>
</h4>
<p>The current version of Wordler isn't ready for public consumption. As we have just seen, her vocabulary is incomplete. I also know of bugs when there are repeated letters. If you would like a copy anyway, send me an email.</p>
