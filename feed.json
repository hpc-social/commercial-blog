            "content_text": "Like millions of other folks, I play Wordle from the New York Times almost every day. The Times reports that Wordle puzzle number 1497 on Friday, July 25, was especially difficult. The average puzzler required 5.7 attempts and many failed to get the answer in the six moves allowed. I have a MATLAB assistant that I call Wordler and, even with her help, I failed on number 1497. Here's why.(In 2022, Wordle was the most-searched term on Google worldwide. For more interesting facts about Wordle, see the Wikipedia article.)ContentsWordlerWordler's VocabularyWord OneWord TwoWord ThreeWord FourWord FiveWord SixFinal WordSoftwareWordlerMaking a move in Wordle involves two tasks. First, thinking of the words that can be played, and second, deciding which of them to play. I like to make all the key decisions myself, so my assistant does not actually play Wordle. When I ask Wordler for help, she just lists all the words that could be played. It is up to me to choose one.Wordler's VocabularyWordler's vocabulary is a hidden list of 2315 five-letter English words that are the possible solutions. The letter frequencies in this list are not the same as in English itself. For example, English has many five-letter words ending in S, but most of them are plural nouns and third-person singular verbs. The vocabulary does not have any of these.

It contains two popular vowels, and I like to use mathematical and other technical words. On July 25, a gold E from the Times tells me that the answer has an E somewhere, but not in slot number 2. The remaining letters are black, so today's answer does not have any L, A, S or T.(If I were to ask Wordler for assistance with the first word, she would just reply with all 2315 words she knows.) Word TwoFor the second word, I chose PHONE. It has the required E, as well as another popular vowel. It gets a gold O to go with the gold E.(Wordler's suggestion in this situation would have been the 268 words containing an E in any slot except the second. That's not much help.) Word ThreeI know now that I am seeking a word with an E in any slot except 2 or 5, an O in any slot except 3, and no L, A, S, T, P, H or N. I decided to try COVER and am rewarded with three green letters.(Wordler knows 23 words meeting the requirements.) Word FourHere, for the first time, I decided to ask Wordler.

Householder PrizesThe Alston S. Householder Prize is awarded to the author of the best dissertation in numerical linear algebra submitted over the previous three years. This time there were two prize-winning submissions described in a special plenary session on Thursday evening.Alice Cortinovis from the University of Pisa won the prize for a dissertation supervised by Daniel Kressner from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. Jorge Garza-Vargas from Caltech and Jess Banks from U. C. Berkeley shared a second prize for a pair of dissertations supervised by Nikhil Srivastava from Berkeley. Jorge gave the talk. ExcursionA tradition at the seminars is the Wednesday afternoon excursion. This year we had the choice of a serious hike, an easy walk, a visit to a nearby winery, or a nap at the hotel. The walk was on the Gorge trail in Taughannock Falls State Park and was fabulous. Gr&uuml;eziGr&uuml;ezi is Swiss German for Hello. Anyone planning to attend the Householder seminar in 2028 should learn how to pronounce Gr&uuml;ezi. The seminar will be in Pontresina, Switzerland. Bart Vandereycken made the announcement. Pontresina was also the site for the Householder seminar in 1996. The Wednesday excursion at that meeting was a hike down the Morteratsch glacier at Diavolezza.

The Redheffer matrix, which he introduced in 1977, is n-by-n, with elements   R(k,j) = 1, if j = 1 or k divides j,          = 0, otherwiseHere is a spy plot for n = 64. The nonzero elements lie in the first column and on diagonals with integer-valued slopes. M&ouml;bius FunctionAugust M&ouml;bius (1790-1868) was an eminent 19th-century German mathematician. His M&ouml;bius function is a fundamental tool in the study of prime numbers.   mu(k) = 1 if k has an even number of distinct prime factors,         = 0 if k has a repeated prime factor,         = -1 if k has an odd number of distinct prime factors Mertens FunctionFranz Mertens (1840-1927) was born in the Grand Duchy of Posen in the Kingdom of Prussia, which is now Poland. He lived much his life in Vienna, Austria. The Mertens function is the cumulative sum of the M&ouml;bius function.$$ M(n) = \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} \\mu(k) $$M(n) is a running count of the integers that have an even number of prime factors, minus those with an odd number of prime factors. Redheffer = MertensThe determinant of the Redheffer matrix is equal to the Mertens function.det(R(n)) = M(n)Plots of M(n) are also plots of det(R(n)).Mertens ConjectureHow fast does M(n) grow as n increases? Here are plots of M(n) for n in powers of 10 from n = 10 to n = 10^8, together with plots of sqrt(n) and -sqrt(n). We see that, at least for n &lt; 10^8,   |M(n)| &lt; &radic;nThe Mertens conjecture is that this inequality holds for all n as n &rarr; &infin;. This conjecture is of interest because it implies the Riemann hypothesis.Riemann HypothesisThe Riemann hypothesis has been called the &ldquo;Most important unsolved problem in mathematics\". Its resolution is the objective of a Clay Millenium Prize valued at one-million dollars. The hypothesis, proposed by G. F. Bernard Riemann in 1859, concerns the zeta function ζ(z) and the location of its zeros.Riemann ComputationsComputation of the first N non-trivial zeros of ζ(s).                authors                    year                     N   ____________________________________    ____    __________________   Riemann                                 1854                     ?

The Redheffer matrix, which he introduced in 1977, is n-by-n, with elements</p><pre>   R(k,j) = 1, if j = 1 or k divides j,          = 0, otherwise</pre><p>Here is a <tt>spy</tt> plot for n = 64.

His M&ouml;bius function is a fundamental tool in the study of prime numbers.</p><pre>   mu(k) = 1 if k has an even number of distinct prime factors,         = 0 if k has a repeated prime factor,         = -1 if k has an odd number of distinct prime factors</pre><p><img alt=\"\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/mobius.png\" vspace=\"5\" /> </p><h4>Mertens Function<a name=\"7d219b38-27c3-4b59-a878-b38207378b02\"></a></h4><p>Franz Mertens (1840-1927) was born in the Grand Duchy of Posen in the Kingdom of Prussia, which is now Poland. He lived much his life in Vienna, Austria. The Mertens function is the cumulative sum of the M&ouml;bius function.</p><p>$$ M(n) = \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} \\mu(k) $$</p><p>M(n) is a running count of the integers that have an even number of prime factors, minus those with an odd number of prime factors.</p><p><img alt=\"\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/mertens.png\" vspace=\"5\" /> </p><h4>Redheffer = Mertens<a name=\"f3c157c6-623e-40a9-b49b-6875c174e6ee\"></a></h4><p>The determinant of the Redheffer matrix is equal to the Mertens function.</p><p><b>det(R(n)) = M(n)</b></p><p>Plots of M(n) are also plots of det(R(n)).</p><h4>Mertens Conjecture<a name=\"c6cc0275-d896-4240-878d-0b4526b1469c\"></a></h4><p>How fast does M(n) grow as n increases?

The Redheffer matrix, which% he introduced in 1977, is n-by-n, with elements%%     R(k,j) = 1, if j = 1 or k divides j,%            = 0, otherwise%% Here is a |spy| plot for n = 64.  The nonzero elements lie% in the first column and on diagonals with integer-valued slopes.% % <<redheffer.png>>%%% Möbius Function % August Möbius (1790-1868) was an eminent 19th-century German% mathematician.  His Möbius function is a fundamental tool in% the study of prime numbers.% %     mu(k) = 1 if k has an even number of distinct prime factors,%           = 0 if k has a repeated prime factor,%           = -1 if k has an odd number of distinct prime factors%% <<mobius.png>>%%% Mertens Function% Franz Mertens (1840-1927) was born in the Grand Duchy of Posen% in the Kingdom of Prussia, which is now Poland.  He lived much% his life in Vienna, Austria.  The Mertens function is the% cumulative sum of the Möbius function.%% $$ M(n) = \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} \\mu(k) $$%% M(n) is a running count of the integers that have% an even number of prime factors, minus those with% an odd number of prime factors.%% <<mertens.png>>%%% Redheffer = Mertens% The determinant of the Redheffer matrix is equal to the Mertens% function.%% *det(R(n)) = M(n)*%% Plots of M(n) are also plots of det(R(n)).%% Mertens Conjecture% How  fast does M(n) grow as n increases?% Here are plots of M(n) for n in powers of 10 from n = 10 to n = 10^8,% together with plots of sqrt(n) and -sqrt(n). %% <<mertens2x4.png>>%%%% We see that, at least for n < 10^8,%%     |M(n)| < √n%% The Mertens conjecture is that this inequality holds for all n as n → ∞.% This conjecture is of interest because it% implies the Riemann hypothesis.%% Riemann Hypothesis% The Riemann hypothesis has been called the “Most important unsolved % problem in mathematics\".  Its resolution is the objective of a% Clay Millenium Prize valued at one-million dollars.% The hypothesis, proposed by G. F.

A simple example is%%    R = @(s) replace(s,\"A\",\"A+A-A\");%% If you start with%%    s = \"A\"%% and repeat%%    s = R(s)%% three times, the result is%%    A%    A+A-A%    A+A-A+A+A-A-A+A-A%    A+A-A+A+A-A-A+A-A+A+A-A+A+A-A-A+A-A-A+A-A+A+A-A-A+A-A%%% MLogo% <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)% Logo> is a programming language, aimed at young students,% developed in 1967 by MIT professors Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert,% and Cynthia Solomon.  Logo has been very influential, spawning% hundreds of implementations and successors.  MLogo, short for% MATLAB Logo, is another successor.%% A distinctive feature of Logo offprings is \"turtle graphics\".% Basic Logo commands like |step|, |turn|, and |draw| drive a% virtual tortoise, originally a motorized toy, and later a graphics % cursor.

Today, a Google search for the Hat's more formal name, \"Aperiodic Monotile\", yields dozens of links.This blog post is about the Hat and the resulting polyshape object. ContentsAn Aperiodic MonotileTilingsTridecagonsPenrose TilingReflectionsMonotile TilingPolyshapesLevel 0Level 1Level 2Level 3NumbersLevel ColorConvex HullAn Aperiodic MonotileThe authors of the paper that announced the discovery of the Hat are David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers, Craig S. Kaplan and Chaim Goodman-Strauss. The announcement was made in an archive&gt;math preprint with the title \"An Aperiodic Monotile\".Within days of the announcement, articles like this one in Science News appeared. Two months later, Florentin Waligorski created an origami Hat.The official paper was published in June of 2024 in the journal Combinatorial Theory. It was also titled \"An Aperiodic Monotile\".I first heard about the Hat is an article by Erica Klarreich in the magazine Quanta, Hobbyist Finds Math&rsquo;s Elusive &lsquo;Einstein&rsquo; Tile.TilingsQuoting Wikipedia:  A \"tessellation\" or \"tiling\" is the covering of a surface,  often a plane, using one or more geometric shapes, called \"tiles\"  with no overlaps and no gaps.  A \"periodic tiling\" has a repeating pattern. Some special kinds  include regular tilings with regular polygonal tiles all of the  same shape, and semiregular tilings with regular tiles of more  than one shape and with every corner identically arranged.  A tiling that lacks a repeating pattern is called \"aperiodic\".  An aperiodic tiling uses a small set of tile shapes that  cannot form a repeating pattern.TridecagonsA tridecagon is a polygon with 13 sides, like this gold coin from the Czech Republic. The sides of a regular tridecagon are all the same length. Any attempt to tile your floor with these coins inevitably has gaps. Regular tridecagons cannot tile the plane. The Hat is an irregular tridecagon that can tile the plane. Penrose TilingRoger Penrose is a Nobel prize-winning mathematician and physicist. Among his many achievements are the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse and the Penrose tiling. The Penrose tiling uses these regular quadrilateral tiles, the \"kite\" and the \"dart\", to produce an aperiodic tiling with two tiles. The Hat generates an aperiodic tiling with a single tile. Steve Eddins is a FOC-winning French horn player. Among his many achievements is a Cleve's Corner about this Penrose tiling. ReflectionsWe say that the Hat on the left is reflected and the one on the right is not reflected. Monotile TilingHere is (a finite piece of) an infinite, aperiodic tiling of the plane using only the Hat and its reflection. This figure is one half of figure 2.12 from the original preprint, \"An Aperiodic Monotile\". Each dark blue tile is surrounded by three light blue tiles. The white tiles appear alone or in pairs. If you look carefully, you can see the grey tiles form filaments. The filaments are more apparent in the other half of figure 2.12 on page 20 of the preprint.The dark tiles are not reflected; all of the other tiles are reflected. PolyshapesQuoting the MATLAB documentation for the polyshape object.  The polyshape function creates polygon-like shapes from 2-D vertices.  However, unlike polygons, a polyshape can have discontiguous regions  and holes. The properties of a polyshape object describe its vertices,  solid regions, and holes.All of the figures after this point in the blog post were made with polyshape/plot.We begin with a pentagonal polyshape made from a portion of a regular hexagon. The Hat itself is a polyshape formed from the union of four rotated and translated copies of the pentagon. Level 0We have experimented with a tiling created by expanding rings of unreflected hats centered around a single reflected hat. We stop after three rings because additional reflected hats are needed to continue.The zeroth level is a single reflected hat. Level 1The first level adds a ring of three hats. Level 2The second ring has nine more hats. Level 3The level 3 ring has 18 hats. NumbersOur Hats program allows you to move a hat around the screen with your mouse. When you get close to another hat, numbers appear to guide your final approach. Here are vertices 8, 9 and 10 on hat number 6 near vertices 12, 11 and 10 on hat number 2. This crowded figure shows all the hat numbers and all the vertex indices at level 2. Level ColorEach level has a single color.0 Dark blue1 Light blue2 White3 GreyCompare this with the detail in figure 2.12 of \"An Aperiodic Monotile\". Convex HullConvex hull is one of many other methods available for polyshape objects. Get       the MATLAB code (requires JavaScript)      Published with MATLAB&reg; R2024b",

Some special kinds %    include regular tilings with regular polygonal tiles all of the %    same shape, and semiregular tilings with regular tiles of more%    than one shape and with every corner identically arranged.%%    A tiling that lacks a repeating pattern is called \"aperiodic\". %    An aperiodic tiling uses a small set of tile shapes that%    cannot form a repeating pattern.%% Tridecagons% A _tridecagon_ is a polygon with 13 sides, like this gold coin from% the Czech Republic. The sides of a _regular_ _tridecagon_ are all% the same length.  Any attempt to tile your floor with these coins% inevitably has gaps.  Regular tridecagons cannot tile the plane.% The Hat is an _irregular_ tridecagon that can tile the plane. %% <<20_CZK.png>>%%% Penrose Tiling% <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose Roger Penrose> is a% <https://www.google.com/search?q=Nobel+prize Nobel prize-winning>% mathematician and physicist.% Among his many achievements are the% <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%E2%80%93Penrose_inverse% Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse> and the% <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling Penrose tiling>.% The Penrose tiling uses these regular quadrilateral tiles,% the \"kite\" and the \"dart\", to produce an aperiodic tiling with% two tiles.% The Hat generates an aperiodic tiling with a _single_ tile.%% <<Kite_Dart.png>>%% <https://steveeddins.com/ Steve Eddins> is a % <https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/foc.txt FOC-winning>% French horn player.% Among his many achievements is a % <https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/2018/11/26/penrose-and-fourier-design-playing-cards/% Cleve's Corner> about this Penrose tiling.%% <<Penrose.png>>% %% Reflections% We say that the Hat on the left is reflected and the one on the right% is not reflected.%% <<polarity.png>>%%% Monotile Tiling% Here is (a finite piece of) an infinite, aperiodic tiling of the plane% using only the Hat and its reflection.  % This figure is one half of figure 2.12 from the original preprint,% <https://doi.org/10.5070/C64163843 \"An Aperiodic Monotile\">.% Each dark blue tile is surrounded by three light blue tiles.% The white tiles appear alone or in pairs.% If you look carefully, you can see the grey tiles form filaments.% The filaments are more apparent in the other half of figure 2.12% on page 20 of the preprint.%% The dark tiles are not reflected; all of the other tiles are reflected.%% <<monotile_tiling.png>>%%% Polyshapes% Quoting the MATLAB documentation for the% <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/polyshape.html% |polyshape object|>.%%    The polyshape function creates polygon-like shapes from 2-D vertices.%    However, unlike polygons, a polyshape can have discontiguous regions%    and holes.

But the matrix is not positive definite, so the eigenvalues do not equal the singular values. See Bringing Back the Bucky Ball.    B = bucky;    A = B(1:n,1:n);    mat_expo(A,'bucky')     CheckerboardWe introduced the Checkerboard family just two weeks ago; see Two Flavors of SVD. There are only two nonzero eigenvalues and singular values.    A = checkerboard(n/4,2,2);    mat_expo(A,'checkerboard') CompanionBefore 1965, the fact that the eigenvalues of a companion matrix are equal to the zeros of the polynomial with coefficients in the first row was often the basis of methods to compute matrix eigenvalues. But the discovery of modern QR methods allowed the first MATLAB to reverse this approach and compute polynomial zeros as matrix eigenvalues.In this example, the polynomial coefficients are 1:n+1 and the polynomial zeros lie on a nearly circular curve in the complex plane.    c = 2:n+1;    A = diag(ones(n-1,1),-1);    A(1,:) = -c;    mat_expo(A,'companion') FiedlerFiedler companion matrix. Discovered by a contemporary Czech mathematician, Miroslav Fiedler, this matrix distributes the polynomial coefficients along the diagonals of an elegant pentadiagonal matrix whose eigenvalues are equal to the zeros of the polynomial. See Fiedler companion matrix.Here is the same polynomial as the traditional companion matrix.

See Redheffer and One Million Dollars and M&ouml;bius, Mertens and Redheffer.Most of the eigenvalues of the Redheffer matrix are equal to one. The product of all the eigenvalues, the determinant, is the Mertens function, which is related to the Riemann hypothesis.    A = gallery('redheff',n);    mat_expo(A,'redheffer') PermutationA permutation matrix has a single 1 in each row and column and 0's elsewhere. The matrix is orthogonal, so all the eigenvalues lie on the unit circle and all the singular values are equal to one.    p = randperm(n);    A = sparse(p,1:n,1);    mat_expo(A,'permutation')     RandomThis random matrix has about 1/3 of its elements equal to zero and the remaining elements normally distributed about zero.

            "content_text": "MATLAB has two different ways to compute singular values. The easiest is to compute the singular values without the singular vectors. Use svd with one output argument, s1.  s1 = svd(A)The alternative is to use svd with three outputs. Ignore the first and third output and specify the second output to be a column vector, s2.  [~,s2,~] = svd(A,'vector')The MathWorks technical support team receives calls from observant users who notice that the two approaches might produce different singular values. Which is more accurate, s1 or s2? Which is faster? Which should we use?I found myself asking the same questions.A key feature of all our experiments is the rank of the matrix. Let's investigate three cases: a rank 2 matrix, a low rank matrix, and a full rank matrix.ContentsCheckerboardLow RankFull RankTimingRemarksSoftwareCheckerboardThe first example, motivated by a recent query, is an 80-by-80 matrix of zeros and ones derived from the checkerboard function in the Image Processing Toolbox.    A = double(checkerboard &gt; 0);The rank of the checkerboard matrix is 2.    r = rank(A)r =     2The image function provides the same portrait of A as its spy plot.    imagem(A)    title('rank 2') Let's begin with the exact singular values. The two nonzero singular values are both equal to 40. The zero singular value has multiplicity 78.    s = [40; 40; zeros(78,1)];    disp('  s =')    disp(s(1:5))    disp('     :')    disp(s(end-2:end))  s =    40    40     0     0     0     :     0     0     0A perfect plot of the singular values of a rank 2 matrix would look like this.    plotem(s)    title('rank 2') What do we get when we actually compute the SVD of the checkerboard?The built-in SVD function uses Householder reflections to reduce the matrix to bidiagonal form. When the vectors are not required, a divide and conquer iteration then reduces the bidiagonal to diagonal. In all our examples, after divide and conquer has found the nonzero singular values, all that remains is roundoff error. Despite this fact, the iterations are continued in order to find all singular values \"to high relative error independent of their magnitudes.\" We have roundoff in roundoff, then roundoff in roundoff in roundoff, and so on.The following logarithmic plot of s1 for the checkerboard matrix shows the phenomenon that I like to call \"cascading roundoff\". There are lines at norm(A) and at    tol = eps(norm(A))tol =   7.1054e-15This is the tolerance initially involved in the convergence test. The steps in the plot are at powers of tol.    s1 = svd(A);    plotem(s1,inf)    title('rank 2') If we specify three outputs, the iterative portion of the SVD function uses a traditional QR iteration with a more conservative convergence criterion instead of divide and conquer. There is no cascading roundoff. All the s2 singular values that would be zero with exact computation are of size tol.    [~,s2,~] = svd(A,'vector');    plotem(s1,s2,[-48,4])    title('rank 2') The plots of s1 and s2 are very different, and neither plot looks like the plot of the exact answer. However, all three plots agree about the double value at 40. And all the disagreements, including the cascading roundoff in s1, are below the line at tol.The checkerboard example shows that s1 and s2 can be very different, but s1 and s2 are much closer to each other than either is to the right answer.Low RankFor a matrix with rank between 2 and full order n, we can use the venerable Hilbert matrix. We have a row vector j and a column vector k in a singleton expansion.    n = 80;    j = 1:n;    k = (1:n)';    A = 1./(k+j-1);The effective rank turns out to be 17.    r = rank(A)r =    17The elements of this Hilbert matrix vary over three orders of magnitude, so a logarithmic image is appropriate.    imagem(floor(log2(A)))    title('low rank') Compare the one-output and the three-output singular values,    s1 = svd(A);    [~,s2,~] = svd(A,'vector');    plotem(s1,s2,[-22,3])    title('low rank') The results s1 and s2 agree about the first 17 values and all disagreements are below the line at tol.Full RankUsing the same column vector k and row vector j in another example of single expansion produces a full rank matrix.    A = min(k,j);Check that A has full rank.    r = rank(A)r =    80The logarithm is not needed for this image.    imagem(A)    title('full rank') Compare the one-output and the three-output singular values,    s1 = svd(A);    [~,s2,~] = svd(A,'vector');    plotem(s1,s2,[-2,4])    title('full rank') With full rank, all values of s1 and s2 are essentially equal. Any line at tol would be irrelevant.TimingWhich is faster, s1 or s2?One extensive timing experiment involves matrices with full rank and with orders   n = 250:250:5000The times measured for computing s1 and s2 are shown by the o's in the following plot.Since the time complexity for computing SVD is O(n^3), we fit the data by cubic polynomials. For large n, the time required is dominated by the n^3 terms. The ratio of the coefficients of these dominate terms is   ratio = 1.17In other words, for large problems s1 is about 17 percent faster than s2.    timefit  RemarksI will admit to a personal preference for s2 over s1. I am more familiar with QR than I am with divide and conquer. As a result, I have more confidence in s2.I realize that the LAPACK divide and conquer driver DSVDD can achieve the stated goal of finding all singular values \"to high relative error independent of their magnitudes\" if the input A is bidiagonal and known exactly. But I don't see that in MATLAB with s1. I suspect that MATLAB does not make a special case for bidiagonal svd.I will be very happy to see any other examples.

Use |svd| with one output argument, s1.%%    s1 = svd(A)%% The alternative is to use |svd| with three outputs.  Ignore the % first and third output and specify the second output to be a% column vector, s2.%%    [~,s2,~] = svd(A,'vector')%% The MathWorks technical support team receives calls from observant% users who notice that the two approaches might produce different% singular values.% Which is more accurate, s1 or s2?% Which is faster?% Which should we use?%% I found myself asking the same questions.%% A key feature of all our experiments is the _rank_ of the matrix.% Let's investigate three cases: a rank 2 matrix, a low rank matrix,% and a full rank matrix.%% Checkerboard% The first example, motivated by a recent query,% is an 80-by-80 matrix of zeros and ones% derived from the |checkerboard| function in the% Image Processing Toolbox.    A = double(checkerboard > 0); %%% The rank of the checkerboard matrix is 2.      r = rank(A)%%% The |image| function provides the same portrait of A as its |spy| plot.    imagem(A)    title('rank 2')%%% Let's begin with the exact singular values.% The two nonzero singular values are both equal to 40.% The zero singular value has multiplicity 78.    s = [40; 40; zeros(78,1)];    disp('  s =')    disp(s(1:5))    disp('     :')    disp(s(end-2:end))%%% A perfect plot of the singular values of a rank 2 matrix% would look like this.    plotem(s)    title('rank 2')%%% What do we get when we actually compute the SVD of the checkerboard?%% The built-in SVD function uses Householder reflections to reduce% the matrix to bidiagonal form.  When the vectors are not required,% a divide and conquer iteration then reduces the bidiagonal to diagonal.% In all our examples, after divide and conquer has found the nonzero% singular values, all that remains is roundoff error.  Despite this% fact, the iterations are continued in order to find all singular% values \"to high relative error independent of their magnitudes.\"% We have roundoff in roundoff, then roundoff in roundoff in roundoff,% and so on. %% The following logarithmic plot of s1 for the checkerboard matrix% shows the phenomenon that I like% to call \"cascading roundoff\". There are lines at |norm(A)| and at    tol = eps(norm(A))%%% This is the tolerance initially involved in the convergence test.% The steps in the plot are at powers of |tol|.    s1 = svd(A);    plotem(s1,inf)    title('rank 2')%%% If we specify three outputs, the iterative portion of the SVD function% uses a traditional QR iteration with a more conservative convergence % criterion instead of divide and conquer.% There is no cascading roundoff. All the s2 singular values% that would be zero with exact computation are of size |tol|.    [~,s2,~] = svd(A,'vector');    plotem(s1,s2,[-48,4])    title('rank 2')%%% The plots of s1 and s2 are very different, and neither plot looks like% the plot of the exact answer. However, all three plots agree about the% double value at 40.  And all the disagreements, including the cascading% roundoff in s1, are below the line at |tol|.%% The checkerboard example shows that s1 and s2 can be very different,% but s1 and s2 are much closer to each other than either is to the % right answer.%% Low Rank% For a matrix with rank between 2 and full order n, we can use the% venerable Hilbert matrix. We have a row vector j and a column vector k% in a singleton expansion.    n = 80;    j = 1:n;    k = (1:n)';    A = 1./(k+j-1);%%% The effective rank turns out to be 17.    r = rank(A)   %%% The elements of this Hilbert matrix vary over three orders of% magnitude, so a logarithmic image is appropriate.    imagem(floor(log2(A)))    title('low rank')%%% Compare the one-output and the three-output singular values,    s1 = svd(A);    [~,s2,~] = svd(A,'vector');    plotem(s1,s2,[-22,3])    title('low rank')%%% The results s1 and s2 agree about the first 17 values and% all disagreements are below the line % at |tol|.%% Full Rank% Using the same column vector k and row vector j in another% example of single expansion produces a full rank matrix.    A = min(k,j);%%% Check that A has full rank.    r = rank(A)%%% The logarithm is not needed for this image.    imagem(A)    title('full rank')%%% Compare the one-output and the three-output singular values,    s1 = svd(A);    [~,s2,~] = svd(A,'vector');    plotem(s1,s2,[-2,4])    title('full rank')%%% With full rank, all values of s1 and s2 are essentially equal.% Any line at |tol| would be irrelevant.%% Timing% Which is faster, s1 or s2?%% One extensive timing experiment involves matrices with full rank% and with orders% %   n = 250:250:5000  %% The times measured for computing s1 and s2 are shown by the o's in% the following plot.%% Since the time complexity for computing SVD is O(n^3),% we fit the data by cubic polynomials.% For large n, the time required is dominated by the n^3 terms.% The ratio of the coefficients of these dominate terms is%%   ratio = 1.17%% In other words, for large problems s1 is about 17 percent faster % than s2.    timefit %% Remarks% I will admit to a personal preference for s2 over s1.% I am more familiar with QR than I am with divide and conquer.% As a result, I have more confidence in s2.%% I realize that the LAPACK divide and conquer driver DSVDD can achieve% the stated goal of finding all singular values \"to high relative error% independent of their magnitudes\" if the input A is bidiagonal and% known exactly.  But I don't see that in MATLAB with s1.% I suspect that MATLAB does not make a special case for bidiagonal svd.%% I will be very happy to see any other examples.% Please comment.%% Software% This blog post is executable.

LissajousYou may well have seen Lissajous curves before, but have you ever listened to them? They were first studied extensively by Jules Lissajous, a nineteenth-century French physicist. There are many Lissajous curves similar to the following, where the trajectory in the x-y plane is described by two functions of a parameter t.n = 200;t = 3*pi*(-1:2/n:1);x = 5*cos(t)+3*cos(5/3*t);y = 5*sin(t)-sin(5/3*t);This 40-second video employs sound produced by resampling a note from a xylophone.+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/lissajous.mp4+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +Here is the last frame. tansinI have used variations of this function many times.F = @(x) tan(sin(x))+sin(tan(x));When x approaches an integer multiple of pi, both sin(x) and tan(x) approach zero, so F(x) also approaches zero. But when x approaches an odd multiple of pi/2, tan(x) becomes infinite, so both sin(tan(x)) and F(x) oscillate infinitely often.Here is a link to a 45-second video of F(x) for n = 200 evenly spaced values of x between -2pi and 2pi.

After each of the posts, readers and colleagues offered suggestions to speed up the calculations. Here is a summary of what I have learned.ContentsM&ouml;bius FunctionMertens FunctionRedheffer MatricesOEISTen MillionMertens ConjectureConjecture is FalseMatricesSparsityComputing Mertens#1#2#3#4#5PerformanceM&ouml;bius Function The function named after the mid-nineteenth century German mathematician August M&ouml;bius is fundamental to the study of prime numbers. The M&ouml;bius function maps the positive integers onto -1,0 and +1.  mu(n) = 0 if n has a repeated prime factor,        = (-1)^(number prime factors) if the factors of n are not repeatedHere is my code for the M&ouml;bius function. It relies on factor(n) which uses a sieve to find the prime factors of n.  function mu = mobius(n)     % mu = mobius(n) returns mu(1:n).     mu = -eye(1,n);     for k = 2:n         f = factor(k);         d = diff([1 f]);         if any(d == 0)             mu(k) = 0;         else             mu(k) = (-1)^length(f);         end     end  endHere is a graph of mu(n) for n = 1:40. For example, mu(29:31) are all -1 because 29 and 31 are both prime and 30 has an odd number of prime factors, 2, 3 and 5.    mu = moebius(40);    plot(1:40,mu,'.-','linewidth',1.5,'markersize',16)    axis([-242-1.51.5])    title('M&ouml;bius function') Mertens Function The Mertens function is named after the late-nineteenth century Polish mathematician Franz Mertens. The function, which we denote by M(n), is simply the partial sums of the M&ouml;bius function. The MATLAB code is very short.  function M = mertens(n)     % M = mertens(n) returns Mertens(1:n).     mu = moebius(n);     M = cumsum([1 mu(2:n)]);  endHere is a graph of M(n) for n = 1:40.    M = mertens(40);    plot(1:40,M,'.-','linewidth',1.5,'markersize',16)    axis([-242-4.51.5])    title('Mertens function') Redheffer Matrices The twentieth-century American mathematician Ray Redheffer, who was a professor at UCLA for 55 years, had a wide range of interests. He was the author of several popular textbooks, the inventor of the electronic game Nim and, with Ray and Charles Eames, the creator of a four-meter long poster Men of Modern Mathematics.The n-by-n Redheffer's matrix R(n) is a matrix of zeros and ones. For j &gt; 1, the element R(k,j) equals one if j is a divisor of k. And importantly, for j = 1, the first column R(:,1) is all ones.  function R = redheffer(n)     k = 1:n;     j = k';     R = (mod(k,j) == 0);     R(:,1) = 1;  endNick Higham put Redheffer's matrix in the MATLAB Gallery several years ago. Here is a spy plot of the 200-by-200.    R = gallery('redheff',200);    spy(R)    title('Redheffer') OEISIn the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, the Mertens function is OEIS/A002321. One of the many cool features of the OEIS is \"listen\", which generates music driven by the sequences. Take a look -- and a listen -- to my 63 second movie about A002321.https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/mertens_plot.mp4Ten MillionHere are plots of M(1:n) with n ranging from 100 to 10 million. Each plot after the first also shows the range of the previous plot. I will discuss the red lines in the next section    load mertens M    tiledlayout(2,3)    for n = 10.^(2:7)        nexttile        mertens_plot(M(1:n))    end Mertens ConjectureThe red lines above are plots of &plusmn;sqrt(n). They clearly bound M(n) for n up to 10 million. The Mertens Conjecture is that this holds for all n.  |M(n)| &lt; sqrt(n) for all n &gt; 0The conjecture appears in a 1885 letter from Thomas Stieltjes to Charles Hermite and in a 1897 paper by Mertens.Wikipedia says  It is a striking example of a mathematical conjecture proven false  despite a large amount of computational evidence in its favor.Conjecture is FalseIn 1985, 100 years after the Stieltjes letter, Andrew Odlyzko and Herman te Riele proved that the conjecture is false. Their proof is indirect. They prove the existence of infinitely many n for which  |M(n)|/sqrt(n) &gt; 1.06But they do not know the value of any particular n. They informally estimate that such an n would be greater than 10^30 and probably much larger.MatricesLet's get back to the world of matrices. It is not obvious, but is true, that the determinants of Redheffer matrices are equal to the Mertens function.  det(R(n)) = M(n)So, if I could have proved that  |det(R(n))| &lt; sqrt(n) for all n &gt; 0I would have had a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.It might appear that I am out of the clutches of number theory and safely back to matrix computation. But that illusion does not last for long.SparsityThe 0(n^3) memory required by the Redheffer matrix from the gallery runs out of steam quickly. We need to take advantage of sparsity. This function generates the sparse representation of a Redheffer matrix directly.  function R = spredheffer(n)      j = (1:n)';      k = ones(n,1);      m = n;      for i = 2:n          t = [1 i:i:n];          p = length(t);          j(m+(1:p)) = t;          k(m+(1:p)) = i;          m = m+p;      end      R = sparse(k,j,1,n,n);  endComputing MertensHere are five methods for computing the Mertens function.#1The first simply takes the determinant of the Redheffer matrix in the gallery.  M = det(gallery('redheff',n))#2The sparse Gaussian elimination function lu with one input and four sparse outputs is designed for solving sparse linear systems. Written primarily by Tim Davis and included in his UMFPACK package, the function uses an unsymmetric pattern multifrontal pivoting strategy to reduce fill-in while maintaining numerical stability. The determinant of the input matrix is the product of the four determinants of the output matrices. Two them are triangular and two are permutations, so it is easy, and quick, to compute their determinants.  R = spredheffer(n);  [L,U,P,Q] = lu(R)  M = det(L)*det(U)*det(P)*det(Q);#3Pat Quillen realized that by interchanging the first and last columns, there would be little fill-in. We need only one determinant.  R = spredheffer(n);  R(:,[1 n]) = R(:,[n 1]);  M = -det(R);#4A thoughtful reader of the blog submitted a suggestion based on the Schur complement. Suppose E is a block matrix,  E = [A B       C D]Schur's formula for the determinant of E is  det(E) = det(D)*det(A - B*(D\\C))Apply this to R(n) with A the (1,1) entry, which is 1, and D the lower (n-1)-by-(n-1) submatrix, which is upper triangular with ones on the diagonal and determinant equal 1. This leads to method #4 which uses backslash with a sparse, unit, upper triangular matrix. There is a Redheffer matrix, but no determinant.  S = spredheffer(n);  e = ones(n-1,1);  M = 1 - e'*(S(2:n,2:n)\\e);#5Once we have generated R(n) and computed M(n), how do we get R(n+1) and M(n+1)? After several iterations of this approach, I found myself without any matrices and only the original definitions of M&ouml;bius and Mertens.  mu = mobius(n);  M = cumsum([1 mu(2:n)]);PerformanceLet's summarize the five methods. The first four generate a single, isolated value of M(n). Method #5 generates M(n) for all n from 1 to any specified maximum.        matrix     function    dets    M  #1    full       gallery       1     1  #2    sparse     lu            4     1  #3    sparse     swap          1     1  #4    sparse     \\             0     1  #5    none       factor        0    manyTime in seconds to compute M(n) on my Lenovo T14 laptop running Windows.    n    2e4      2e5      2e6     2e7  #1    28.652     -        -       -  #2     0.344   21.77      -       -  #3     0.086    1.29    16.4  #4     0.055    0.65     6.7    70.1  #5     0.075    0.80    10.7   204.5Get       the MATLAB code (requires JavaScript)      Published with MATLAB&reg; R2024a",

They clearly bound <tt>M(n)</tt> for <tt>n</tt> up to 10 million. The Mertens Conjecture is that this holds for all <tt>n</tt>.</p><pre>  |M(n)| &lt; sqrt(n) for all n &gt; 0</pre><p>The conjecture appears in a 1885 letter from Thomas Stieltjes to Charles Hermite and in a 1897 paper by Mertens.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertens_conjecture\">Wikipedia</a> says</p><pre>  It is a striking example of a mathematical conjecture proven false  despite a large amount of computational evidence in its favor.</pre><h4>Conjecture is False<a name=\"21f44074-f0af-4aa2-b6a3-adb1a2756ea2\"></a></h4><p>In 1985, 100 years after the Stieltjes letter, Andrew Odlyzko and Herman te Riele proved that the conjecture is false. Their proof is indirect. They prove the existence of infinitely many <tt>n</tt> for which</p><pre>  |M(n)|/sqrt(n) &gt; 1.06</pre><p>But they do not know the value of any particular <tt>n</tt>. They informally estimate that such an <tt>n</tt> would be greater than 10^30 and probably much larger.</p><h4>Matrices<a name=\"e485344f-bda2-4d4d-9fd0-e7102df79117\"></a></h4><p>Let's get back to the world of matrices. It is not obvious, but is true, that the determinants of Redheffer matrices are equal to the Mertens function.</p><pre>  det(R(n)) = M(n)</pre><p>So, if I could have proved that</p><pre>  |det(R(n))| &lt; sqrt(n) for all n &gt; 0</pre><p>I would have had a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.</p><p>It might appear that I am out of the clutches of number theory and safely back to matrix computation. But that illusion does not last for long.</p><h4>Sparsity<a name=\"5ffa1b4e-3fe8-4908-a32c-b41a2d162cd6\"></a></h4><p>The <tt>0(n^3)</tt> memory required by the Redheffer matrix from the gallery runs out of steam quickly. We need to take advantage of sparsity. This function generates the sparse representation of a Redheffer matrix directly.</p><pre>  function R = spredheffer(n)      j = (1:n)';      k = ones(n,1);      m = n;      for i = 2:n          t = [1 i:i:n];          p = length(t);          j(m+(1:p)) = t;          k(m+(1:p)) = i;          m = m+p;      end      R = sparse(k,j,1,n,n);  end</pre><h4>Computing Mertens<a name=\"39aa4540-d55c-47d1-882b-33b04368d495\"></a></h4><p>Here are five methods for computing the Mertens function.</p><h4>#1<a name=\"25c55aa9-7b26-4eb8-ae66-fbfbefea38b1\"></a></h4><p>The first simply takes the determinant of the Redheffer matrix in the <tt>gallery</tt>.</p><pre>  M = det(gallery('redheff',n))</pre><h4>#2<a name=\"4c32719f-3698-4320-a518-3b9d554916f9\"></a></h4><p>The sparse Gaussian elimination function <tt>lu</tt> with one input and four sparse outputs is designed for solving sparse linear systems. Written primarily by Tim Davis and included in his UMFPACK package, the function uses an unsymmetric pattern multifrontal pivoting strategy to reduce fill-in while maintaining numerical stability. The determinant of the input matrix is the product of the four determinants of the output matrices. Two them are triangular and two are permutations, so it is easy, and quick, to compute their determinants.</p><pre>  R = spredheffer(n);  [L,U,P,Q] = lu(R)  M = det(L)*det(U)*det(P)*det(Q);</pre><h4>#3<a name=\"1d535f36-08d5-4044-87d1-b3aa7094574a\"></a></h4><p>Pat Quillen realized that by interchanging the first and last columns, there would be little fill-in. We need only one determinant.</p><pre>  R = spredheffer(n);  R(:,[1 n]) = R(:,[n 1]);  M = -det(R);</pre><h4>#4<a name=\"4b32160d-f00c-46f0-861a-4fe8cf231394\"></a></h4><p>A thoughtful reader of the blog submitted a suggestion based on the Schur complement. Suppose <tt>E</tt> is a block matrix,</p><pre>  E = [A B       C D]</pre><p>Schur's formula for the determinant of <tt>E</tt> is</p><pre>  det(E) = det(D)*det(A - B*(D\\C))</pre><p>Apply this to <tt>R(n)</tt> with <tt>A</tt> the (1,1) entry, which is 1, and <tt>D</tt> the lower (n-1)-by-(n-1) submatrix, which is upper triangular with ones on the diagonal and determinant equal 1. This leads to method #4 which uses backslash with a sparse, unit, upper triangular matrix. There is a Redheffer matrix, but no determinant.</p><pre>  S = spredheffer(n);  e = ones(n-1,1);  M = 1 - e'*(S(2:n,2:n)\\e);</pre><h4>#5<a name=\"e624ea53-1063-4c25-a75f-c186f877d82c\"></a></h4><p>Once we have generated <tt>R(n)</tt> and computed <tt>M(n)</tt>, how do we get <tt>R(n+1)</tt> and <tt>M(n+1)</tt>? After several iterations of this approach, I found myself without any matrices and only the original definitions of M&ouml;bius and Mertens.</p><pre>  mu = mobius(n);  M = cumsum([1 mu(2:n)]);</pre><h4>Performance<a name=\"75297d30-41f2-45ca-ad62-8e710261ee95\"></a></h4><p>Let's summarize the five methods.

They prove the existence of% infinitely many |n| for which%%    |M(n)|/sqrt(n) > 1.06%% But they do not know the value of any particular |n|.  They informally% estimate that such an |n| would be greater than 10^30 and probably% much larger.%% Matrices% Let's get back to the world of matrices.  It is not obvious,% but is true, that the determinants of Redheffer matrices% are equal to the Mertens function.% %    det(R(n)) = M(n)%% So, if I could have proved that %%    |det(R(n))| < sqrt(n) for all n > 0%% I would have had a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.%% It might appear that I am out of the clutches of number theory% and safely back to matrix computation.  But that illusion does% not last for long.%% Sparsity% The |0(n^3)| memory required by the Redheffer matrix % from the gallery runs out of steam quickly.% We need to take advantage of sparsity.% This function generates the sparse representation of % a Redheffer matrix directly.%%    function R = spredheffer(n)%        j = (1:n)';%        k = ones(n,1);%        m = n;%        for i = 2:n%            t = [1 i:i:n];%            p = length(t);%            j(m+(1:p)) = t;%            k(m+(1:p)) = i;%            m = m+p;%        end%        R = sparse(k,j,1,n,n);%    end%%% Computing Mertens% Here are five methods for computing the Mertens function.%%% #1% The first simply takes the determinant of the Redheffer matrix% in the |gallery|.%%    M = det(gallery('redheff',n))%%% #2% The sparse Gaussian elimination function |lu| with one% input and four sparse outputs is designed for solving sparse linear% systems.  Written primarily% by Tim Davis and included in his UMFPACK package, the function% uses an unsymmetric pattern multifrontal pivoting strategy % to reduce fill-in while maintaining numerical stability.% The determinant of the input matrix is the product of the four% determinants of the output matrices. Two them are triangular and two% are permutations, so it is easy, and quick, to compute their determinants.%%    R = spredheffer(n);%    [L,U,P,Q] = lu(R)%    M = det(L)*det(U)*det(P)*det(Q);%%% #3% Pat Quillen realized that by interchanging the first and last% columns, there would be little fill-in.  We need only one determinant.%%    R = spredheffer(n);%    R(:,[1 n]) = R(:,[n 1]);%    M = -det(R);%%% #4%% A thoughtful reader of the blog submitted a suggestion based on the% Schur complement.  Suppose |E| is a block matrix, %%    E = [A B%         C D]% % Schur's formula for the determinant of |E| is%%    det(E) = det(D)*det(A - B*(D\\C))%% Apply  this to |R(n)| with |A| the (1,1) entry, which is 1,% and |D| the lower (n-1)-by-(n-1) submatrix, which is upper triangular% with ones on the diagonal and determinant equal 1.  This leads to method% #4 which uses backslash with a sparse, unit, upper triangular matrix.% There is a Redheffer matrix, but no determinant.%%    S = spredheffer(n);%    e = ones(n-1,1);%    M = 1 - e'*(S(2:n,2:n)\\e);% %% #5% Once we have generated |R(n)| and computed |M(n)|, how do we get% |R(n+1)| and |M(n+1)|?  After several iterations of this approach,% I found myself without any matrices and only the original definitions% of Möbius and Mertens.%%    mu = mobius(n);%    M = cumsum([1 mu(2:n)]);%%% Performance% Let's summarize the five methods.

One of the systems replied:Certainly! I'll create a MATLAB program to test the Mertensconjecture. First, let me briefly explain what the Mertensconjecture is, and then I'll provide the code.The Mertens conjecture states that the Mertens function M(n)is bounded by &radic;n for all positive integers n.

You could also consider the matrix as a 2x2 block matrix and  use the formula for the determinant of a block matrix [1].      A = redheffer(n);      M = full(A(1,1) - A(1, 2:end) * (A(2:end,2:end) \\ A(2:end, 1)));  Since the (n-1)x(n-1) block is upper triangular, the solve becomes  a back-substitution.redmertMy new program is named redmert, an abbreviation of Redheffer-Mertens. It uses the fact that redheffer(n) is obtained from redheffer(n-1) by appending the last column.Let R(n) denote the upper or right-triangular part of redheffer(n).  R(n) = triu(redheffer(n))R(n) is sparse, upper triangular and has ones on the diagonal. The indices of the nonzeros in the last column of R(n) are the factors of n. For example, here is R(8).R8 = full(triu(redheffer(8)))R8 =     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     0     1     0     1     0     1     0     1     0     0     1     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1The idea behind redmert is to compute a sequence of Redheffer matrices, R, and associated values of the Mertens function, M.  [M,R] = redmert(p,R)The input is a scalar integer p, the desired sequence length, and a sparse matrix R, the upper triangle of a Redheffer matrix of some order, n. The output is an integer vector of values M(n+1:n+p) and the upper triangle of the Redheffer matrix of order n+p. This output R can then be used as the input R in another call to redmert.The sequence is started with an empty R.For example,[M,R] = redmert(8,[]);The output is mertens(n), n = 1:8, and R8 from the example above.MR8 = full(R)M =     1     0    -1    -1    -2    -1    -2    -2R8 =     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     0     1     0     1     0     1     0     1     0     0     1     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1Inside redmertThe entire code for redmert is twelve lines long.

Now I can't stop thinking about them.Redheffer's matrix has been in the MATLAB Gallery for a long time, but I have ignored it .Redheffer's matrix can be used to compute Mertens function and investigate the Mertens conjecture.A proof of the Mertens conjecture would also provide a proof of the Riemann hypothesis.For nearly a century, all the available computational evidence indicated that the Mertens conjecture was likely to be true.The Riemann hypothesis is the most important unsolved problem in mathematics and wins a Clay prize worth one-million dollars.MATLAB's sparse matrix functions turn out to be useful in an investigation of Redheffer's matrix and the Mertens conjecture.However, it has been known since 1985 that the Mertens conjecture is false.ContentsRedheffer's MatrixM&ouml;bius FunctionMertens FunctionMertens ConjectureMertens Meets RedhefferRedheffer SparsityredhefferSparse LUmertensMertens Conjecture Is FalsePostscriptsReferencesRedheffer's MatrixRaymond Redheffer (1921-2005) was an American mathematician, a professor at UCLA for 55 years, the author of several popular textbooks, the inventor of the electronic game Nim and, with Ray and Charles Eames, the creator of a four-meter long poster Men of Modern Mathematics.Redheffer's matrix is a matrix of zeros and ones. A(k,j) equals one if j is a divisor of k. In addition, the first column is all ones.  function A = redheffer(n)      k = 1:n;      j = k';      A = (mod(k,j) == 0);      A(:,1) = 1;  endOr  A = gallery('redheff',n)Here is the 10-by-10.

A = redheffer(200);    spy(A)    title('redheffer(200)') M&ouml;bius FunctionThe M&ouml;bius function was introduced in 1832 by German mathematician August M&ouml;bius and is ubiquitous in the study of prime numbers. For positive integers n, μ(n) is0 if n has a squared prime factor,+1 if n is square-free and has an even number of prime factors,-1 if n is square-free and has an odd number of prime factors.Mertens FunctionFranz Mertens (1840-1927) was a Polish mathematician who spent most of his career in Austria at the University of Vienna. Here is a link to a biography of Mertens at the University of St. Andrews MacTutor project.The Mertens function is sum of values of the M&ouml;bius function. For a positive integer n, the Mertens function is   M(n) = sum(μ(1:n))So M(n) is the difference between the number of square-free integers with an even number of prime factors and those with an odd number.This graphic shows M(n) for n = 1:100000.    mertens_plot_2 Mertens ConjectureThe Mertens function M(n) fluctuates wildly and grows slowly with increasing n. The graphic shows that M(n) is easily bounded by of sqrt(n) and -sqrt(n), at least for n less than 100k. The Mertens conjecture is that this continues for larger n.  -sqrt(n) &lt; M(n) &lt; sqrt(n) for all nThe conjecture was included in a letter from Stieltjes to Hermite in 1895 and in a paper by Mertens in 1897. The result is important since a proof of the Mertens conjecture would imply the truth of the Riemann hypothesis.Mertens Meets RedhefferI became interested in all this when I learned that the determinant of the MATLAB Gallery matrix which I have ignored for years is related to the Riemann hypothesis and the million-dollar prize.  M(n) = det(gallery('redheff',n))I know very little about the distribution of prime numbers and computing values of the M&ouml;bius function. On the other hand, I know a lot about numerical linear algebra and computing determinants.In general, I am dead set against computing determinants. They are often used to check for singularity or to somehow compute eigenvalues. But here the determinant is an integer counter of modest size.Redheffer SparsityComputing M(n) directly with det(redheffer(n)) requires O(n^2) space and O(n^3) time and is not practical for large n.However, A = redheffer(n) is modestly sparse. Here is the fraction of nonzeros.  s = nnz(A)/n^2    disp(sparsity)       n         s        _____    ________    10000    0.001037    20000    0.000553    30000    0.000382    40000    0.000294    50000    0.000239    60000    0.000203    70000    0.000176    80000    0.000156    90000    0.000139    1e+05    0.000127Taking advantage of this sparsity and the MATLAB tools for sparse matrix computation provide linear space complexity and perhaps O(n^2) time complexity.redhefferHere is MATLAB code to generate a sparse redheffer(n) without creating any full intermediate matrices.type    redheffer    function A = redheffer(n)        j(1:n) = (1:n)';        k(1:n) = 1;        m = n;        for i = 2:n            t = [1 i:i:n]';            p = length(t);            j(m+(1:p)) = t;            k(m+(1:p)) = i;            m = m+p;        end        A = sparse(k,j,1,n,n);    endAs expected, we see that the execution time for redheffer(n) is a linear function of n. (The space required also grows linearly.)    redheffer_time Sparse LUThe MATLAB Gaussian elimination function lu with one sparse input and four sparse outputs is designed for solving sparse linear systems.  [L,U,P,Q] = lu(A)Written primarily by Tim Davis and included in his UMFPACK package, the function uses an unsymmetric pattern multifrontal pivoting strategy to find permutations P and Q so that L is lower triangular, U is upper triangular and  P*A*Q = L*UConsequently, the determinant of A is the product of four easily computed determinants.  det(A) = det(L)*det(U)*det(P)*det(Q)The pivoting strategy aims to reduce fill-in while maintaining numerical stability.For example, here are L and U for the Redheffer matrix in the spy plot near the top of this blog post.    close    A = redheffer(200);    [L,U,P,Q] = lu(A);    spy(L|U)    title('L|U') And here are the four determinants.    dets = [det(L),det(U),det(P),det(Q)];    disp(dets)    1    -8    -1    -1Finally, M(200) is    M_200 = det(L)*det(U)*det(P)*det(Q)    M_200 =        -8mertensMertens function can be computed with four lines of code.    type    mertens    function M = mertens(n)        der = @(x) full(round(prod(diag(x))));        A = redheffer(n);        [L,U,P,Q] = lu(A);        M = der(L)*der(U)*det(P)*det(Q);    endExecution time for mertens is dominated by the time in sparse lu. The time required to compute the four determinants is an order of magnitude smaller than the other two.Experimentally, we see that the time complexity of sparse lu is O(n^2), but we have no proof.    mertens_time Mertens Conjecture Is FalseThe Mertens conjecture stood for nearly 100 years before it was proved false in 1985 by Andrew Odlyzko and Herman te Riele. The authors present indirect proofs that  lim sup (n -&gt; inf) M(n)/sqrt(n) &gt; 1.06  lim inf (n -&gt; inf) M(n)/sqrt(n) &lt; -1.009Odlyzko and te Riele do not actually produce any value of n for which M(n) &gt; sqrt(x). They suspect that any Mertens conjecture counterexample requires n &gt; $10^{30}$, which is far beyond any computation possible today.Odlyzko and te Riele also describe several complete tabulations of M(n) for n as large as $7.8 \\cdot 10^{9}$ . These computations do not use Redheffer determinants.PostscriptsTo tell the truth, I did not really expect to find any Mertens or Riemann counterexamples. I did, however, enjoy computing determinants for the first time and discovering an unexpected use for sparse LU.Thanks a lot to Tim Davis for his help with this post.ReferencesA. M. Odlyzko and H. J.

But here the determinant is an% integer counter of modest size.%% Redheffer Sparsity% Computing |M(n)| directly with |det(redheffer(n))| requires% |O(n^2)| space and |O(n^3)| time and is not practical for% large |n|.%% However, |A = redheffer(n)| is modestly sparse.% Here is the fraction of nonzeros.% %    s = nnz(A)/n^2          disp(sparsity)%% % Taking advantage of this sparsity and the MATLAB tools for% sparse matrix computation provide% linear space complexity and perhaps |O(n^2)| time complexity.%% |redheffer|% Here is MATLAB code to generate a sparse |redheffer(n)| without% creating any full intermediate matrices.    type redheffer%%% As expected, we see that the execution time for |redheffer(n)|% is a linear function of |n|.  (The space required also grows linearly.)    redheffer_time%% Sparse LU% The MATLAB Gaussian elimination function |lu| with one sparse% input and four sparse outputs% is designed for solving sparse linear systems.% %    [L,U,P,Q] = lu(A)%% Written primarily% by Tim Davis and included in his UMFPACK package, the function% uses an unsymmetric pattern multifrontal pivoting strategy to% find permutations |P| and |Q| so that |L| is lower triangular,% |U| is upper triangular and%%    P*A*Q = L*U%% Consequently, the determinant of |A| is the product of four easily% computed determinants.%%    det(A) = det(L)*det(U)*det(P)*det(Q)%% The pivoting strategy aims to reduce fill-in while maintaining% numerical stability.%%% For example, here are |L| and |U| for the Redheffer matrix% in the spy plot near the top of this blog post.    close    A = redheffer(200);    [L,U,P,Q] = lu(A);    spy(L|U)    title('L|U')    %%% And here are the four determinants.    dets = [det(L), det(U), det(P), det(Q)];    disp(dets)%%% Finally, |M(200)| is    M_200 = det(L)*det(U)*det(P)*det(Q)%% |mertens|% Mertens function can be computed with four lines of code.    type mertens%%% Execution time for |mertens| is dominated by the time in sparse |lu|.% The time required to compute the four determinants is an order of% magnitude smaller than the other two.  %% Experimentally, we see that the time complexity of sparse |lu| is% |O(n^2)|, but we have no proof.       mertens_time%% Mertens Conjecture Is False% The Mertens conjecture stood for nearly 100 years before it was % proved false in 1985 by Andrew Odlyzko and Herman te Riele.% The authors present indirect proofs that%%    lim sup (n -> inf) M(n)/sqrt(n) > 1.06%%    lim inf (n -> inf) M(n)/sqrt(n) < -1.009%% Odlyzko and te Riele do not actually produce any value of |n| for % which |M(n) > sqrt(x)|. They suspect that any Mertens conjecture% counterexample requires |n| > $10^{30}$, which is far beyond any% computation possible today.%% Odlyzko and te Riele also describe several complete tabulations of % |M(n)| for |n| as large as $7.8 \\cdot 10^{9}$ .  These computations% do not use Redheffer determinants.%% Postscripts% To tell the truth, I did not really expect to find any Mertens or% Riemann counterexamples.  I did, however, enjoy computing determinants% for the first time and discovering an unexpected use for sparse LU. %% Thanks a lot to Tim Davis for his help with this post.%% References% A. M.

The NA-Digest is one of world's first examples of social networking. The Digest is one of the forces that makes our community a living, viable community.The Digest is part of NA-Net, which also includes Netlib, a collection of mathematical software, papers, and databases.For its first forty years, the NA-Digest has had only four editors. Now, we are adding two more. As we do that, I would like to take a personal look back at the history of the NA-Digest.ContentsGene and MarkJack and EricTammy and DannyDavid and AlexArchiveMembersImportant PostingsThanksReferencesGene and MarkLike many other developments in the numerical analysis world, the Digest began with Gene Golub. In the early 1980's, Golub was chair of Stanford's Computer Science Department. Email was a new thing and Gene maintained a list of email addresses for his many friends around the world. Email addresses came in many different formats; today's system of domain names was not yet in wide spread use.In 1984, Mark Kent, one of Gene's grad students, with help from Ray Tuminaro, Mark Crispin and Dan Kolkowitz, wrote software that used Gene's list in an email forwarding service. Mail sent tona.name@su-scorewould be forwarded to the person with that last name. And email sent tona@su-scorewould be forwarded to everyone on the list.Gene and Mark Kent began to gather contributions together and send the collection out periodically. By February 1987, this had evolved into a moderated weekly newsletter. Gene dubbed these email services the NA-Net.Nick Trefethen has this memory.  Early in the days of email, domain names were all over the place.  I think there was a period when Gene was using xxx.na for the  names of numerical analysts.  Then somebody decided addresses should  end with the country, giving us .uk and .fr and .ch and all  that.  For a period, we found that a lot of our numerical  analysis emails were being directed to Namibia!In 1987, Gene asked me to moderate NA-Digest temporarily while he went on a sabbatical. That temporary position ultimately lasted 18 years, until 2005.Jack and EricJack Dongarra began his career at Argonne National Laboratory. Jack's colleague, Eric Grosse, began his career at Bell Labs. In 1984, Jack and Eric created Netlib, a software repository and distribution service, and merged it with NA-Net. In 1989, Jack and the NA-Net system moved from Argonne to Oak Ridge National Lab and the University of Tennessee.Keith Moore, at the University of Tennessee, rewrote the NA-Net software and maintained the servers for many years.Gerald Ragghianti, the Technical Services Leader at Tennessee's Innovative Computer Lab, currently maintains the NA-Net software and servers.Tammy and DannyIn 2005, I asked Tammy Kolda, who was then at Sandia Labs in Livermore, to be the NA-Digest editor. Tammy's Wikipedia page reveals that her given name is \"Tamara\", but everybody calls her \"Tammy\". She left Sandia is 2021 and now has her own consulting company, MathSci.ai.In 2010, Tammy recommended that Danny Dunlavy, from Sandia Labs in Albuquerque, take over as editor. He has been the editor for 14 years. Danny's day job at Sandia's Center for Computing Research involves a wide range of fields including computer architecture, cognitive modeling and discrete mathematics. David and Alex Starting next week, NA-Digest and NA-Net will move lock, stock, and barrel to Cornell University. The new editors are David Bindell and Alex Townsend. Cornell's IT organization will be taking over the logistics.David, Alex and Anil Damle are also the hosts for Householder XXII, June 8-13, 2025.ArchiveEvery issue of NA-Digest since February 1987 is available at https://www.netlib.org/na-digest-html.MembersWhen I succeeded Gene as editor in 1987, there were about 800 names on the NA-Net mailing list. Today, in 2024, there are a little over 10,000. Discontinuities in the size of the list result when unused and illegitimate names are removed. Important PostingsI have made three personally important announcements in the Digest over the years.October 29, 1989In 1989 I was working at Ardent Computer, a startup in Silicon Valley. I announced in NA-Digest that MathWorks was looking for a numerical analyst. (Note the MathWorks telephone number near the end of this announcement.)  From: Cleve Moler &lt;na.moler@na-net.stanford.edu&gt;  Date: Sun Oct 29 10:39:38 PST 1989  Subject: Positions at The MathWorks  The MathWorks is the company which develops and markets MATLAB.  The company currently employs about 30 people and expects to  add three or four more soon. The company headquarters is in  East Natick, Massachusetts, which is about a half hour drive  west of Boston.  The background and interests expected for the various positions  available range from numerical linear algebra and matrix computation  to systems programming and graphics. Educational level and  experience expected range from inexperienced beginner willing  to learn to seasoned Ph.D. with a personal library of M-files.  For more information, send email to na.moler@na-net.stanford.edu  or phone me at 408-732-0400. Or, contact the MathWorks' president,  John Little, with email to jnl@mathworks.com, phone 508-653-1415,  or write to:  The MathWorks  21 Eliot Street  South Natick, MA 01760November 26, 1989Shortly after that announcement, Ardent imploded and I said that I was taking the job myself.  From: Cleve Moler &lt;moler@mathworks.com&gt;  Date: Sun Nov 26 09:16:32 PST 1989  Subject: Change of Address for Moler  A couple of weeks ago, I made an announcement here that  The MathWorks, the MATLAB company, was looking to fill several  positions, including one for a numerical analyst. Now, I've  decided to take that slot myself. I'm one of the founders of  MathWorks, and have always been a consultant to the company, but  now I'll be a full time employee. For a while at least, I'll  be working out of my home in California, even though MathWorks  headquarters is in Massachusetts. (There are already a couple  of other MathWorks developers in the Bay Area.)  . . .  My electronic address is \"moler@mathworks.com\". If your mailer  can't find the route via uunet to mathworks.com, you can still  use \"na.moler@na-net.stanford.edu\".November 16, 2007In November 2007 I was attending the Super Computing conference in Reno. I had rented a car and intended to drive to the Bay Area after the conference. But my wife called me and said, \"Hey Cleve, have you heard that Gene is in the hospital?\" I left SC immediately and drove to Palo Alto. Two days later we sent out a special issue of the Digest:  From: Cleve Moler &lt;Cleve.Moler@mathworks.com&gt;  Date: Fri, 16 Nov 2007 17:55:42 -0500  Subject: Gene Golub, 1932 - 2007  Gene Golub, founder of the NA Digest, passed away today, Friday, November 16,  at the Stanford University Hospital. He was 75 years old.  Gene returned home to Stanford recently from a trip to Hong Kong. He was  planning to leave again Tuesday on another trip, this one to Zurich where the  ETH was to honor him with a special degree. Instead, Sunday night he went to  the emergency room because he was \"feeling lousy\". On Tuesday, he was found  to have AML, acute myelogenous leukemia, a form of cancer that affects the  white blood cells. This is a potentially curable disease and he was expecting  to begin chemotherapy today. But serious complications developed suddenly  over night.  I was able to see Gene for an hour last night and he was in reasonably good  spirits. Mike Saunders was trying to get Gene's laptop to use dial-up over  the hospital's phone system because Gene said he was a couple of days behind  on his email. I was planning to get a wireless card for his machine today.  None of us had any idea how suddenly the situation would worsen.  The Stanford ICME students have created a memorial blog at  http://genehgolub.blogspot.com .  Our community has lost its foremost member. He was a valued colleague and  friend. Goodbye, Gene.  -- Cleve MolerThanksGene Golub and Mark Kent for creating NA-Digest and NA-Net.Tammy Kolda and Danny Dunlavy for editing the Digest for two decades.Jack Dongarra, Eric Grosse, Keith Moore and Geri Ragghianti for creating Netlib and for hosting the system for four decades.David Bindel and Alex Townsend for joining this team.ReferencesJack Dongarra, Gene Golub, Eric Grosse, Cleve Moler and Keith Moore. \"Netlib and NA-Net: Building a Scientific Computing Community\", IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, (Volume: 30, Issue: 2, April-June 2008).

In the early 1980's, Golub was chair of Stanford's% Computer Science Department. Email was a new thing and Gene% maintained a list of email addresses for his many friends% around the world.  Email addresses came in many different formats;% today's system of domain names was not yet in wide spread use.%% In 1984, Mark Kent, one of Gene's grad students,% with help from Ray Tuminaro, Mark Crispin and Dan Kolkowitz,% wrote software that used Gene's list in an email% forwarding service.  Mail sent to%% |na.|_name_|@su-score|%% would be forwarded to the person with that last name. And email sent to%% |na@su-score| %% would be forwarded to everyone on the list.%% Gene and Mark Kent% began to gather contributions together% and send the collection out periodically.  By February 1987, this% had evolved into a moderated weekly newsletter.% Gene dubbed these email services the _NA-Net_.%% Nick Trefethen has this memory.%%    Early in the days of email, domain names were all over the place.%    I think there was a period when Gene was using xxx.na for the%    names of numerical analysts.  Then somebody decided addresses should%    end with the country, giving us .uk and .fr and .ch and all%    that.  For a period, we found that a lot of our numerical %    analysis emails were being directed to Namibia!%% In 1987, Gene asked me to moderate NA-Digest temporarily while he% went on a sabbatical.  That temporary position ultimately% lasted 18 years, until 2005.%%% Jack and Eric% <https://history.siam.org/oralhistories/dongarra.htm Jack Dongarra>% began his career at Argonne National Laboratory. Jack's colleague,% Eric Grosse, began his career at Bell Labs.% In 1984, Jack and Eric created Netlib, a software repository and% distribution service, and merged it with NA-Net.% In 1989, Jack and the NA-Net system moved from Argonne to % Oak Ridge National Lab and the University of Tennessee.%% Keith Moore, at the University of Tennessee,% rewrote the NA-Net software and maintained the servers for many years.%% Gerald Ragghianti, the Technical Services Leader at% Tennessee's Innovative Computer Lab, currently maintains the NA-Net% software and servers.%% Tammy and Danny% In 2005, I asked Tammy Kolda, who was then at Sandia Labs% in Livermore, to be the NA-Digest editor.% Tammy's <https://www.google.com/search?q=tamara+kolda Wikipedia page>% reveals that her given name is \"Tamara\", but everybody calls her \"Tammy\".  % She left Sandia is 2021 and now has her own consulting company,% <https://www.mathsci.ai/ MathSci.ai>. % % In 2010, Tammy recommended that Danny Dunlavy, from Sandia Labs in % Albuquerque, take over as editor.  He has been the editor for 14 years.% Danny's day job at Sandia's% <https://www.sandia.gov/ccr Center for Computing Research>% involves a wide range of fields including computer architecture,% cognitive modeling and discrete mathematics.%% <<OldEditors.png>>%%% David and Alex%% <<NewEditors.png>>%% <https://www.netlib.org/na-digest-html/24/v24n11.html% Starting next week>, NA-Digest and NA-Net will move% <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock,_stock,_and_barrel% lock, stock, and barrel> to Cornell University.% The new editors are% <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/bio David Bindell>% and% <https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~ajt/ Alex Townsend>.% Cornell's IT organization will be taking over the logistics.%% David, Alex and <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~damle/#About Anil Damle>% are also the hosts for % <https://householder-symposium.github.io Householder XXII>,% June 8-13, 2025.%% Archive% Every issue of NA-Digest since February 1987% is available at% <https://www.netlib.org/na-digest-html>.%% Members% When I succeeded Gene as editor in 1987, there were about 800 names% on the NA-Net mailing list.

Computing the singular values and singular% vectors of a particular matrix would sometimes cause MATLAB to crash. %% Two Computers% I use two different two computers regularly.% The machine in my home office is a Lenovo ThinkPad(R)% model T14, loaded with two external monitors, several external% disc drives, a sound bar and a dedicated internet connection.% My traveling machine is a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano with no external% hardware.%% The report of a crash in the SVD became even more interesting when% I found that it happens on my office computer, but not on the portable.% A quick check revealed that the CPUs on the two machines come from % different manufacturers.% The office computer uses an AMD(R) Ryzen Pro 5% while the traveling machine uses an Intel(R) Core i7.%%% Math Libraries% The crash occurs several software layers deep in% <https://netlib.org/lapack/explore-3.3.0-html/d5/d1f/cgesvd_8f_source.html% CGESVD>, the LAPACK driver for single precision complex SVD.% Various chip manufacturers provide math libraries that have been% optimized for their CPUs.

They will soon sort this all out.% In the meantime, here is what I have learned about the offending% matrix.%% G3366394% We refer to the matrix in the crash report by its case% number in our bug tracking system.% The matrix is of modest size but% is otherwise unusual for several reasons.% It is rectangular with fewer rows than columns,% it is in single precision, and it is complex.%%    clear%    load g3366394 X%    whos%%    Name        Size              Bytes  Class     Attributes%    X         219x384            672768  single    complex   %%% The following code calling SVD with three outputs% will crash MATLAB on  my T14, but not on my X1.%%    trysvd = false%    if trysvd%        [U,S,V] = svd(X);%        R = U*S*V' - X;%        relres = norm(R)/norm(X)%    end%%    trysvd =%      logical%        0%% Rank% Computing the singular values without the vectors can be done% on either machine.

These misgivings often occur in discussion of vector sums. Our provocatively named SuperSum is intended to calm these fears.ContentsLedgersChecksumsOrderSpeedThree SumsToy ExampleSecond TestConclusionLedgersA ledger is a list of transactions in an account. Auditing the ledger involves comparing the total of the items with the change in the account balance.If v is a vector of transaction amounts, then we need to computesum(v)If this sum is equal to the change in the balance, then it is reasonable to assume that the ledger is correct. If not, the ledger must be examined line-by-line.ChecksumsHave you ever used a checksum for a file transfer? One checksum is computed before the file is sent. After the file has been sent over a questionable channel, a second checksum is computed on the receiving end. If the two checksums agree, the transmission was probably okay. If not, the file must be sent again.OrderFloating point addition is not associative. This means(a + b) + cis not necessarily the same asa+(b+c).So the order of doing a computation is important.Computers are deterministic devices. If the same computation is done in the same order more than once, the results must be the same. If you get different sums from different runs on a fixed computer, then it must be because the order has been changed.SpeedIn recent years, we have made the built-in function sum(x) faster by parallelizing it. The input vector is broken into several pieces, the sum of each piece is computed separately and simultaneously, then the partial sums are combined to give the final result. If the number and size of the pieces varies from run to run, the order varies and consequently the computed sums may vary.Three SumsHere are three replacements for nansum(x), the version of sum(x) that skips over NaNs and infs.simplesumAvoid the effect of blocking in the built-in sum(x).function s = simplesum(x)     % simplesum.  s = simplesum(x), for vector(x).     % Force sequential order for sum(x).     % Skips NaNs and infs.     s = 0;     for k = 1:length(x)         if isfinite(x(k))             s = s + x(k);         end     endendKahanSumThis is the Kahan summation algorithm. The sum is accumulated in two words, the more significant s and the correction c. If you were able to form s + c exactly, it would be more accurate than s alone.function s = KahanSum(x)     % KahanSum.  s = KahanSum(x), for vector(x).     % More accurate, but slower, than sum(x).     % Skips NaNs and infs.     % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm.     s = 0;  % sum     c = 0;  % correction     for k = 1:length(x)         if isfinite(x(k))             y = x(k) - c;             t = s + y;             c = (t - s) - y;             s = t;         end     endendSuperSumI gave it a pretentious name to grab attention.

In this situation, KahanSum is no more accurate than sum.format hexx = [1 1e-14 -1]'[nansum(x) simplesum(x) KahanSum(x) SuperSum(x)]x =   3ff0000000000000   3d06849b86a12b9b   bff0000000000000ans =   3d06800000000000   3d06800000000000   3d06800000000000   3d06849b86a12b9bConclusionI will leave careful timing for another day. Let's just say that in situations like jeuTest, KahanSum is probably all you need. It is usually more accurate than sum, and not much slower.However, for complete reliability, use SuperSum.

Our provocatively named% _SuperSum_ is intended to calm these fears.%% Ledgers% A _ledger_ is a list of transactions in an account.% _Auditing_ the ledger involves comparing the total of % the items with the change in the account balance.%% If _v_ is a vector of transaction amounts, then we% need to compute%%  sum(v)% % If this sum is equal to the change in the balance, then it is% reasonable to assume that the ledger is correct.% If not, the ledger must be examined line-by-line.%%% Checksums% Have you ever used a checksum for a file transfer?% One checksum is computed before the file is sent.  After the file% has been sent over a questionable channel, a second checksum is % computed on the receiving end.  If the two checksums agree,% the transmission was probably okay.  If not, the file must be% sent again.%% Order% Floating point addition is not _associative_.  This means%%  (a + b) + c%% is not necessarily the same as%%   a + (b + c).%% So the _order_ of doing a computation is important.%% Computers are deterministic devices.  If the same% computation is done _in the same order_ more than once,% the results must be the same.% If you get different sums from different runs on a fixed% computer, then it must be because the order has been % changed.%% Speed% In recent years, we have made the built-in function |sum(x)|% faster by parallelizing it.  The input vector is broken into% several pieces, the sum of each piece is computed separately% and simultaneously, then the partial sums are combined to give% the final result.  If the number and size of the pieces varies% from run to run, the order varies and consequently the computed% sums may vary.%% Three Sums% Here are three replacements for |nansum(x)|,% the version of |sum(x)| that skips over |NaNs| and |infs|.%% *simplesum*%% Avoid the effect of blocking in the built-in sum(x).%%  function s = simplesum(x)%       % simplesum.  s = simplesum(x), for vector(x).%       % Force sequential order for sum(x).%       % Skips NaNs and infs.%%       s = 0;%       for k = 1:length(x)%           if isfinite(x(k))%               s = s + x(k);%           end%       end%  end%% *KahanSum*%% This is the Kahan summation algorithm.% The sum is accumulated in two words, the more significant% |s| and the correction |c|.% If you were able to form |s + c| exactly, it would be more% accurate than |s| alone.%%  function s = KahanSum(x)%       % KahanSum.  s = KahanSum(x), for vector(x).%       % More accurate, but slower, than sum(x).%       % Skips NaNs and infs.%       % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm.%   %       s = 0;  % sum%       c = 0;  % correction%       for k = 1:length(x)%           if isfinite(x(k))%               y = x(k) - c;%               t = s + y;%               c = (t - s) - y;%               s = t;%           end%       end%  end%% *SuperSum*%% I gave it a pretentious name to grab attention.% Use extended precision, with enough digits to hold any MATLAB double.%%  function s = SuperSum(x) %       % SuperSum.  s = SuperSum(x), for vector(x).%       % Symbolic Math Toolbox extended precision.%       % Skips NaNs and infs.%       %%       % 632 decimal digits holds every IEEE-754 double.%       % 632 = ceil(log10(realmax) - log10(eps*realmin));%       %%       din = digits(632);  % Remember current setting%       s = double(sum(sym(x(isfinite(x)),'D')));%       digits(din)         % Restore%  end%% Toy Example% A test case here at MathWorks, known by a French-Canadian name that% translates to \"toy example\", has a vector |e2|% of length 4243 and values that range from -3.3e7 to 6.8e9.%% When running tests involving floating point numbers% it is a good idea to set the output format to |hex|% so we can see every last bit.%%  format hex%  load jeuTest e2%  x = e2;%%  [nansum(x)%   simplesum(x)%   KahanSum(x)%   SuperSum(x)]%%  ans =%     423785e8206150e2%     423785e8206150e0%     423785e8206150e1%     423785e8206150e1%% For |jeuTest|,  Kahan summation gets the same result as |SuperSum|,% while |nansum| and |simplesum| differ in the last bit or two.%%% Second Test% The vector length is only three, but the third term completely% cancels the first, and the second term rises from obscurity.% In this situation, |KahanSum| is no more accurate than |sum|.% %  format hex%  x = [1 1e-14 -1]'%%  [nansum(x)%   simplesum(x)%   KahanSum(x)%   SuperSum(x)]%%  x =%     3ff0000000000000%     3d06849b86a12b9b%     bff0000000000000%%  ans =%     3d06800000000000%     3d06800000000000%     3d06800000000000%     3d06849b86a12b9b%% Conclusion% I will leave careful timing for another day.  Let's just say that  % in situations like |jeuTest|, |KahanSum| is probably all you need.% It is usually more accurate than |sum|, and not much slower.%% However, for complete reliability, use |SuperSum|.

I have two twenty-line MATLAB functions, ieee2ibm and ibm2ieee, that convert IEEE-754 floating point to and from IBM hexadecimal format.Three statements in the middle of ieee2ibm are the key to the entire operation. The first statement is    [~,e] = log2(x)With two output arguments, log2 returns the mantissa and exponent of an IEEE-754 floating point number. The mantissa is not needed here.The second key statement    e = ceil(e/4)makes e divisible by 4. This turns e into the appropriate hexadecimal exponent so that the third statement    f = x.*16.^(-e)can produce the hexadecimal mantissa.ieee2ibmfunction z = ieee2ibm(x)   Convert IEEE-754 to IBM System 360 hexadecimal.   z = ieee2ibm(x)      Input x, real column vector.

Consequently, hexadecimal has a much smaller range, 5.4e-79 to 7.2e+75 versus 2.2e-308 to 1.8e+308.The base-16 normalization implies that hexadecimal effectively has between 53 and 56 mantissa bits. Counting the hidden bit, IEEE-754 also has 53. So, the accuracy of the two is pretty much the same.SoftwareMy functions ieee2ibm and ieee2ibm described above, modified to handle both single and double, plus hex_test, which does what its name implies, are available at Hex_ieee.Homework: What happens?ok = 0;for k = 1:10     x = single(k/10);     ok(k) = hex_test(x);endokGet       the MATLAB code (requires JavaScript)      Published with MATLAB&reg; R2024a",

Originally there were only 7 observations; today there are 13. The program now allows you to fit the data exactly by interpolation with a polynomial of degree 12 or fit it approximately by polynomials of degree less than 12.Here are the least-squares fits with linear, cubic, and degree seven polynomials and the interpolating polynomial. As the polynomial degree increases, so does R^2, until R^2 reaches one with the exact fit.Do any of these fits look like they could be used to predict future population growth? SplinesIn addition to polynomials, you can choose interpolation by three different piecewise Hermite cubics.spline Continuous second derivate, \"not-a-knot\" end condition.pchip Continuous first derivative, strictly shape-preserving.makima Continuous first derivative, relaxed shape-preserving.Since these fits interpolate the data, all their R^2 values are one. But before 1900 and after 2020 these functions are cubic polynomials that are not designed for extrapolation. ExponentialsIt is also possible to do nonlinear least squares fits by an exponential, a logistic sigmoid, and an exponential of an exponetial known as the Gompertz model.exponential exp(b*t+c)logistic a./(1+exp(-b*(t-c)))gompertz a*exp(-b*exp(-c*t))An article by Kathleen and Even Tj&oslash;rve, from the Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences in Elverum, Norway, in the journal PLOS ONE has this to say about Gompertz. \"The Gompertz model has been in use as a growth model even longer than its better known relative, the logistic model. The model, referred to at the time as the Gompertz theoretical law of mortality, was first suggested and first applied by Mr. Benjamin Gompertz in 1825. He fitted it to the relationship between increasing death rate and age, what he referred to as 'the average exhaustions of a man&rsquo;s power to avoid death&rdquo; or the 'portion of his remaining power to oppose destruction.' \" PredictionsWhich fits are suitable for predicting future population size?Despite their large R^2 values, polynomials of any degree are not suitable because outside of the time interval they behave like polynomials and do not provide realistic predictions.Splines were never intended for extrapolation.That leaves the exponentials. The simple exponential model grows exponentially and is not suitable. The Gompertz fit does approach a finite asymptotic limit, but the value is an astronimical a = 2101, corresponding to 2.1 $\\times 10^9$ inhabitants. Hopefully, that is out of the question.The logistic fit has an asymptotic limit of a = 655.7. We recently passed the value of t where p(t) reaches a/2, namely c = 2018. So, the logistic model predicts that the long-term size of the U.S. population will be about twice its current value. Is that realistic? Probably not. ConclusionThe British statistician George Box once said, \"all models are wrong, some are useful.\" This is true of the models of the U. S. Census that I have discussed over the past sixty years.Here is censusapp2024 after all its buttons have been pushed. The extrapolation date is set to 2040. White noise has been added to the data. The model is a fourth-degree polynomial with an R^2 = 0.99. The R^2 value and the error estimates produced by errs account for errors in the data, but not in the model.This particular model does a lousy job of predicting even twenty years in the future. Some of the other models are better, many are worse. Hopefully, their study is worthwhile.

There are dozens of pages% and videos on the web describing |R^2|, but few of them warn% about possible misuse.%% |R^2| is easily computed. % If |y| is a vector of observations, |f| is a fit to% the data and |ybar = mean(y)|, then% %     R^2 = 1 - norm(y-f)^2/norm(y-ybar)^2 %% If the data are centered, then |ybar = 0| and |R^2| is between% zero and one.%%% One of my favorite examples is the United States Census.% Here is the population, in millions, every ten years since 1900. %%     t         p   %    ____    _______%    1900     75.995%    1910     91.972%    1920    105.711%    1930    123.203%    1940    131.669%    1950    150.697%    1960    179.323%    1970    203.212%    1980    226.505%    1990    249.633%    2000    281.422%    2010    308.746%    2020    331.449%% There are 13 observations.

Among the many things you might want to know is which pair of vehicles is nearest each other.This is an instance of the Closest Pair of Points problem:Given the location of n points in the plane, which pair of points is closest to each other? Closest Pair of PointsIt is convenient to represent the points by a vector of complex values. The distance between points z(k) and z(j) is then  d = abs(z(k) - z(j))Here are a few points in the unit square.  The closest pair is highlighted. PairsThe first algorithm you might think of computes the distances between all possible pairs of points and finds the minimum.  This is a brute force approach that requires only a few lines of code.function d = Pairs(z)    % Pairs.    % d = Pairs(z) is the minimum distance between any two elements    % of the complex vector z.    n = length(z);    d = Inf;    for k = 1:n        for j = k+1:n            if abs(z(k) - z(j)) &lt; d                d = abs(z(k) - z(j));            end        end    endendDivConDivCon stands for Divide and Conquer.  In outline, the steps are:Divide the set of points into two halves.Recursively, find the closest pair in each half.Consider the case when the closest pair has one point in each half.Terminate the recursion with sets of two or three points.function d = DivCon(z,sorted)    % DivCon.    % d = DivCon(z) is the minimum distance between any two elements    % of the complex vector z.    %    % d = DivCon(z,true) is a recursive call with ascending real(z).    n = length(z);    if n &lt;= 3       d = Pairs(z);    else       if nargin &lt; 2 || ~sorted           [~,p] = sort(real(z));           z = z(p);       end       m = floor(n/2);       % Left half       dl = DivCon(z(1:m),true)       % Right half       dr = DivCon(z(m+1:end),true);       % Choose       d = min(dl,dr);       % Center strip       ds = Center(z,d);       d = min(ds,d);    endendCenterThe delicate case involves the strip of points near the center dividing line.  The width of the strip is the closest distance found in the recursion.  Any closer pair with one point in each half must be in this strip.function d = Center(z,d)    % Center(z,d) is used by DivCon to examine the    % strip of half-width d about the center point.    n = length(z)    m = floor(n/2);    xh = real(z(m));    [~,p] = sort(imag(z));    z = z(p);    s = [];    for i = 1:n        if abs(real(z(i)) - xh) &lt;  d            s = [s; z(i)];        end    end    ns = length(s);    for k = 1:ns        for j = k+1:ns            if (imag(s(j)) - imag(s(k))) &lt; d &amp;&amp; abs(s(k) - s(j)) &lt; d                d = abs(s(k) - s(j));            end        end    endendComplexityLet n be the number of points.  An asymptotic execution-time complexity analysis involves n approaching infinity.It is not hard to see that the complexity of the brute force algorithm implemented in Pairs is O(n^2).There are dozens of pages on the web devoted to showing that the complexity of the divide and conquer algorithm implemented in DivCon and Center is O(n*log(n)).  The best page that I have seen is the YouTube video by Ling Qi. The key to the analysis is showing that the inner loop in Center is executed at most 7 times for any n.TimingWe measured the execution time of Pairs(z) and DivCon(z) for n from 1,000 to 40,000 and computed the ratios of the two times. The complexity analysis predicts that this ratio is asymptotically  O(n/log(n))Here are the timing results and a least square fit by n/log(n).

            "content_text": "We have been investigating a recent bug report about fitnlm, the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox function for robust fitting of nonlinear models.ContentsQuahogsAcidificationSeparable Least SquaresCentering DataExponential FittingResultsSoftwareThanksQuahogs The bug report comes from Greg Pelletier, an independent research scientist and biogeochemical modeler in Olympia, Washington. Greg has been studying the vulnerability of sensitive marine organisms to increases in ocean acidification.  One of the most important of these organisms is Mercenaria mercenaria, the hard clam.Especially here in New England, hard clams are known by their traditional Native American name, quahog. They have a well-deserved reputation for making excellent clam chowder.AcidificationWe are all aware of increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere.  We may not be as aware of the effect this increase has on the health of the earth's oceans.  According to NOAA, the ocean absorbs about 30% of the atmospheric carbon dioxide.A definitive and controversial 2009 paper by Justin Ries and colleagues, then at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, is \"Marine calcifiers exhibit mixed responses to CO2-induced ocean acidification\", https://doi.org/10.1130/G30210A.1. The hard clam example in Greg's bug report comes from figure 1K in the Ries et al. paper.The independent variable in experiments is the ratio of alkalinity of sea water to the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon. The dependent variable is the calcification rate, which compares how fast the organism builds its shells to how fast the shells are dissolving. Separable Least SquaresThe model chosen by Ries at al. is$$ y \\approx \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 e^{\\lambda t} $$where $t$ is the ratio of alkalinity to dissolved carbon and $y$ is the calcification rate. The data have only four distinct values of $t$, with several observations of $y$ at each value.The parameters $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$ and $\\lambda$ are determined by least squares curve fit.  This is a separable least squares problem. For any given value of $\\lambda$, the parameters $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ occur linearly and the least squares solution can be obtained by MATLAB's backslash.Gene Golub and Victor Pereyra described separable least squares in 1973 and proposed solving it by a variable projection algorithm. Since 1973 a number of people, including Pereyra, Linda Kaufman, Fred Krogh, John Bolstadt and David Gay, have contributed to the development of a series of Fortran programs named varpro. In 2011, Dianne O'Leary and Burt Rust created a MATLAB version of varpro.  Their report, https://www.cs.umd.edu/~oleary/software/varpro/, is a good background source, as well as documentation for varpro.m.I have a section on separable least squares, and an example, expfitdemo, in NCM, Numerical Computing with MATLAB. I have modified expfitdemo to work on Greg's quahogs problem.Centering DataIt turns out that the problem Greg encountered can be traced to the fact that the data are not centered.  The given values of $t$ are all positive.  This causes fitnlm to print a warning message and attempt to rectify the situation by changing the degrees of freedom from 22 to 23, but this only makes the situation worse. (We should take another look at the portion of fitnlm that adjusts the degrees of freedom.)It is always a good idea in curve fitting to center the data with something like  t = t - mean(t)The values of $y$ are already pretty well centered. Rescaling $y$ with  y = 10000*ymakes interpretation of results easier.Exponential FittingWith the data centered and scaled, we have three different ways of tackling Greg's problem.  All three methods agree on the results they compute.fitnlm. Treats all parameters as if they were nonlinear.      Computes statistical quantities such as R-squared and      RMS Error.varpro.

Greg has been studying the vulnerability of sensitive marine organisms to increases in ocean acidification.  One of the most important of these organisms is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_clam\">Mercenaria mercenaria</a>, the hard clam.</p><p>Especially here in New England, hard clams are known by their traditional Native American name, <i>quahog</i>. They have a well-deserved reputation for making excellent clam chowder.</p><h4>Acidification<a name=\"1fd80451-cc63-4160-8fcc-b1a1448c7382\"></a></h4><p>We are all aware of increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere.  We may not be as aware of the effect this increase has on the health of the earth's oceans.  According to <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/ocean-coasts/ocean-acidification\">NOAA</a>, the ocean absorbs about 30% of the atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p><p>A definitive and controversial 2009 paper by Justin Ries and colleagues, then at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, is \"Marine calcifiers exhibit mixed responses to CO2-induced ocean acidification\", <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1130/G30210A.1\">https://doi.org/10.1130/G30210A.1</a>. The hard clam example in Greg's bug report comes from figure 1K in the Ries et al. paper.</p><p>The independent variable in experiments is the ratio of alkalinity of sea water to the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon. The dependent variable is the calcification rate, which compares how fast the organism builds its shells to how fast the shells are dissolving.</p><p><img alt=\"\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Ries_et_al.png\" vspace=\"5\" /> </p><h4>Separable Least Squares<a name=\"faab8af3-c8dd-48bf-8621-b7fa14ade2fb\"></a></h4><p>The model chosen by Ries at al. is</p><p>$$ y \\approx \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 e^{\\lambda t} $$</p><p>where $t$ is the ratio of alkalinity to dissolved carbon and $y$ is the calcification rate. The data have only four distinct values of $t$, with several observations of $y$ at each value.</p><p>The parameters $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$ and $\\lambda$ are determined by least squares curve fit.  This is a <i>separable least squares</i> problem. For any given value of $\\lambda$, the parameters $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ occur linearly and the least squares solution can be obtained by MATLAB's backslash.</p><p>Gene Golub and Victor Pereyra described separable least squares in 1973 and proposed solving it by a <i>variable projection algorithm</i>. Since 1973 a number of people, including Pereyra, Linda Kaufman, Fred Krogh, John Bolstadt and David Gay, have contributed to the development of a series of Fortran programs named <tt>varpro</tt>. In 2011, Dianne O'Leary and Burt Rust created a MATLAB version of <tt>varpro</tt>.  Their report, <a href=\"https://www.cs.umd.edu/~oleary/software/varpro/\">https://www.cs.umd.edu/~oleary/software/varpro/</a>, is a good background source, as well as documentation for <tt>varpro.m</tt>.</p><p>I have a section on separable least squares, and an example, <tt>expfitdemo</tt>, in NCM, <a href=\"https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/mathworks-dot-com/moler/leastsquares.pdf\">Numerical Computing with MATLAB</a>. I have modified <tt>expfitdemo</tt> to work on Greg's quahogs problem.</p><h4>Centering Data<a name=\"8afd06c3-7aca-4df8-b636-b7d660a3b6ca\"></a></h4><p>It turns out that the problem Greg encountered can be traced to the fact that the data are not centered.  The given values of $t$ are all positive.  This causes <tt>fitnlm</tt> to print a warning message and attempt to rectify the situation by changing the degrees of freedom from 22 to 23, but this only makes the situation worse. (We should take another look at the portion of <tt>fitnlm</tt> that adjusts the degrees of freedom.)</p><p>It is always a good idea in curve fitting to center the data with something like</p><pre>  t = t - mean(t)</pre><p>The values of $y$ are already pretty well centered. Rescaling $y$ with</p><pre>  y = 10000*y</pre><p>makes interpretation of results easier.</p><h4>Exponential Fitting<a name=\"b8434e53-14a6-412e-97d9-39485ad02c07\"></a></h4><p>With the data centered and scaled, we have three different ways of tackling Greg's problem.

This project is my latest effort.ContentsAlibiExploring MatricesYouTube VideosMatrix MultiplicationRotation and ScalingComputer GraphicsMatrices and CubesSimulinkAI and GorillasSoftwareThanksDedicationAlibiOver sixty years ago, as a sophomore contemplating a major in mathematics, I took a course entitled Survey of Modern Algebra. We used a now-classic textbook by MacLane and Birkhoff that featured abstract theorems about groups, rings, fields, vector spaces and linear algebra. I remember the colorful terms alias and alibi had something to do with change  of basis and change of position, but I have never seen those terms again.The next year, I took Numerical Analysis.  We did some of the homework on a Burroughhs 205 Datatron and I wrote a machine language program to solve simultaneous linear equations.  I was hooked.But at the time I did not realize that the two courses were about the same magnificent object -- the matrix.Exploring MatricesExploring Matrices is a multi-media project that shows matrices in action.  Short videos, blog posts, interactive MATLAB software and self-study exercises investigate applications of matrices. The material is intended for studebts in an undergraduate course in linear algebra or computational science. However, anyone using matrices should find topics that interest them.The first release of Exploring Matrices has six modules. All of the modules feature animated MATLAB displays and four of the modules include interactive MATLAB \"apps\". The modules are:Matrix MultiplicationRotation and ScalingComputer GraphicsMatrices and CubesSimulinkAI and Gorillas %YouTube VideosAn introduction and six videos ranging in length from one to six minutes, are available on YouTube athttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn8PRpmsu08oGNmtBfFOmgVC0TlXDaLDJ.The first four of these videos feature animations produced by our four MATLAB apps -- Multiply, Rotate, Grafix, and Qube. The other two videos describe two applications, simulation of control systems and neural networks for facial recognition (of gorillas).Matrix MultiplicationSome viewers may just be learning the mechanics of matrix multiplication. Other viewers will have encountered it years ago. The traditional algorithm for computing the product of two matrices involves inner products between the rows of the first matrix and the columns of the second.  A less familiar algorithm, which involves linear combinations of the columns of the first matrix, is often more efficient and informative.  The two approaches produce the same final result from intermediate terms in different orders.Here is one frame from the animation of these two algorithms generated by our Multiply app.  The highlighted element in the first matrix either moves across the rows or goes down the columns. Rotation and ScalingOur first matrices are 2-by-2.  We see how the matrix$$R \\ = \\\\left(  \\begin{array}{rr}     \\cos{\\theta} &amp; \\sin{\\theta} \\\\    -\\sin{\\theta} &amp; \\cos{\\theta}  \\end{array}  \\right)$$rotates points by the angle $\\theta$, measured in degrees.We also see how the matrix$$S \\ = \\\\left(  \\begin{array}{rr}     \\sigma &amp; 0 \\\\     0 &amp; \\sigma  \\end{array}  \\right)\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\$$makes objects larger and smaller.The two can be combined with matrix multiplication. For more operations in higher dimensions, matrix multiplication provides a unifying framework.Here is one frame from the animation of rotation and scaling generated by the Rotate app.  The first panel displays a 2-by-2 rotation matrix, the second panel displays a 2-by-2 diagonal scaling matrix, and the third panel displays their product. Computer GraphicsOperations with the 4-by-4 matrices that are at the heart of modern computer graphics employ a system known as \"homogeneous coordinates\". The leading 3-by-3 submatrix produces rotation and scaling in three dimensions.  The fourth column produces translations.Here is one frame from an animation of rotation about the x-axis generated by the Grafix app. This is often called \"pitch\".  Rotation about the y- and z-axes are \"roll\" and \"yaw\", Matrices and CubesRubik's Cube, named for its inventor, Ern&#337; Rubik, a Hungarian professor of architecture, is the greatest mathematical puzzle of all time. Our digital simulation of the puzzle, Qube, is powered by rotation matrices.The model consists of 27 identical copies of a single small cubelet whose sides are colored red, white, blue, yellow, orange and green. Initially, all cubelets have the same orientation. A move is the simultaneous rotation of the nine cubelets in one of the six faces, by 90&deg; or 180&deg;, clockwise or counterclockwise.  This leads to $4.3 \\times 10^{19}$ possible configurations for a scrambled cube.The object of the puzzle is to return a scrambled cube to the initial state.  Most people are interested in solving the puzzle rapidly, but I am more interested in the number of moves required.Qube offers animations of many mathematical properties of Rubik's cubes.  Here is a frame from one of them. SimulinkMATLAB's companion product, Simulink, is a block diagram programming environment used to design and simulate systems with multidomain models and to automatically generate the code required to operate embedded processors.Matrices are involved in dozens of different ways by Simulink, but most users rarely see operations at that detailed level. Our Simulink module shows a model of an automobile being driven on a test track and displays the pitch, roll and yaw recorded by the matrix connecting the coordinate system for the automobile to the coordinate system for the track. AI and GorillasThis is a personal story about a project in the early stages of development.My wife and I first visited gorillas in the Volcano National Park of Rwanda twelve years ago. An American primatologist named Dian Fossey had studied the gorillas between 1966 and her murder by poachers in 1985. Her book Gorillas in the Mist was very popular and was the basis for a critically acclaimed 1988 Hollywood movie starring Sigourney Weaver.We have become good friends with the people in the Gorilla Doctors organization. These African and American veterinarians attend to the health of the roughly 1,000 gorillas in the park.  Most of the gorillas have African names like \"Inkundwa\" and \"Maisha\".  We envision a gorilla facial recognition system that is available on cell phones and tablets so that new guides and doctors can learn the names of their patients.Inception-v3 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is widely used for image processing. We have a version of the network pretrained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. This publicly available system knows nothing about gorillas. We must do additional training using photos of our unique subjects.This is where matrices are applied.  Training a CNN involves determining the values of thousands of weights and coefficients.  The digital photos, regarded as vectors, and repeatedly multiplied by circulant matrices where each row is a shifted copy of the other rows.  Importantly, a modern CNN also contains some nonlinear layers.Here is one photo from a small test collection.  Indundwa appears to have his own selfie stick. SoftwareA self-extracting MATLAB source archive of our four apps is available athttps://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Apps_mzip.mThanksThanks to Jackson Kustell, Josh Bethoney and Heather Gorr from MathWorks and Jan Ramer and Mike Cranfield from Gorilla Doctors.DedicationWe dedicate the Gorillas project to the memory of Mike Cranfield, DMV.  Mike was Executive Director of the Mountain Gorillas Veterinary Project in Rwanda from 1999 until 2014.  Before Rwanda, he held various positions at the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore.Three months ago, Mike sent us a disc drive containing over 14,000 photographs of gorillas he had taken in Rwanda.  We are now sorting and organizing the photos to provide  specialized training of the facial recognition neural net.A month ago, Mike was hospitalized from an apparent attack of West Nile Virus.

We used a now-classic textbook by MacLane and Birkhoff that featured abstract theorems about groups, rings, fields, vector spaces and linear algebra. I remember the colorful terms <i>alias</i> and <i>alibi</i> had something to do with change  of basis and change of position, but I have never seen those terms again.</p><p>The next year, I took Numerical Analysis.  We did some of the homework on a Burroughhs 205 Datatron and I wrote a machine language program to solve simultaneous linear equations.  I was hooked.</p><p>But at the time I did not realize that the two courses were about the same magnificent object -- the <i>matrix</i>.</p><h4>Exploring Matrices<a name=\"6c62b301-b35d-4699-a60a-6dc8bd2f86c3\"></a></h4><p>Exploring Matrices is a multi-media project that shows matrices in action.  Short videos, blog posts, interactive MATLAB software and self-study exercises investigate applications of matrices. The material is intended for studebts in an undergraduate course in linear algebra or computational science. However, anyone using matrices should find topics that interest them.</p><p>The first release of Exploring Matrices has six modules. All of the modules feature animated MATLAB displays and four of the modules include interactive MATLAB \"apps\". The modules are:</p><div><ul><li>Matrix Multiplication</li><li>Rotation and Scaling</li><li>Computer Graphics</li><li>Matrices and Cubes</li><li>Simulink</li><li>AI and Gorillas %</li></ul></div><h4>YouTube Videos<a name=\"653e3c66-3977-46c8-aef6-8ae60d87baa9\"></a></h4><p>An introduction and six videos ranging in length from one to six minutes, are available on YouTube at</p><p><a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn8PRpmsu08oGNmtBfFOmgVC0TlXDaLDJ\">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn8PRpmsu08oGNmtBfFOmgVC0TlXDaLDJ</a>.</p><p>The first four of these videos feature animations produced by our four MATLAB apps -- <tt>Multiply</tt>, <tt>Rotate</tt>, <tt>Grafix</tt>, and <tt>Qube</tt>. The other two videos describe two applications, simulation of control systems and neural networks for facial recognition (of gorillas).</p><h4>Matrix Multiplication<a name=\"ea1683fd-3523-4939-8c2e-c581324ac557\"></a></h4><p>Some viewers may just be learning the mechanics of matrix multiplication. Other viewers will have encountered it years ago. The traditional algorithm for computing the product of two matrices involves inner products between the rows of the first matrix and the columns of the second.  A less familiar algorithm, which involves linear combinations of the columns of the first matrix, is often more efficient and informative.  The two approaches produce the same final result from intermediate terms in different orders.</p><p>Here is one frame from the animation of these two algorithms generated by our <tt>Multiply</tt> app.  The highlighted element in the first matrix either moves across the rows or goes down the columns.</p><p><img alt=\"\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Multy.png\" vspace=\"5\" /> </p><h4>Rotation and Scaling<a name=\"254c72ed-9b08-4442-b7a5-6d4f512351ef\"></a></h4><p>Our first matrices are 2-by-2.  We see how the matrix</p><p>$$R \\ = \\\\left(  \\begin{array}{rr}     \\cos{\\theta} &amp; \\sin{\\theta} \\\\    -\\sin{\\theta} &amp; \\cos{\\theta}  \\end{array}  \\right)$$</p><p>rotates points by the angle $\\theta$, measured in degrees.</p><p>We also see how the matrix</p><p>$$S \\ = \\\\left(  \\begin{array}{rr}     \\sigma &amp; 0 \\\\     0 &amp; \\sigma  \\end{array}  \\right)\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\$$</p><p>makes objects larger and smaller.</p><p>The two can be combined with matrix multiplication. For more operations in higher dimensions, matrix multiplication provides a unifying framework.</p><p>Here is one frame from the animation of rotation and scaling generated by the <tt>Rotate</tt> app.  The first panel displays a 2-by-2 rotation matrix, the second panel displays a 2-by-2 diagonal scaling matrix, and the third panel displays their product.</p><p><img alt=\"\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Rotate.png\" vspace=\"5\" /> </p><h4>Computer Graphics<a name=\"cef8c368-00e7-4ccb-9f05-f2435e94a403\"></a></h4><p>Operations with the 4-by-4 matrices that are at the heart of modern computer graphics employ a system known as \"homogeneous coordinates\". The leading 3-by-3 submatrix produces rotation and scaling in three dimensions.  The fourth column produces translations.</p><p>Here is one frame from an animation of rotation about the x-axis generated by the <tt>Grafix</tt> app. This is often called \"pitch\".  Rotation about the y- and z-axes are \"roll\" and \"yaw\",</p><p><img alt=\"\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Graphics.png\" vspace=\"5\" /> </p><h4>Matrices and Cubes<a name=\"eec3c339-e1b1-466c-8361-62f63808b278\"></a></h4><p>Rubik's Cube, named for its inventor, Ern&#337; Rubik, a Hungarian professor of architecture, is the greatest mathematical puzzle of all time. Our digital simulation of the puzzle, <tt>Qube</tt>, is powered by rotation matrices.</p><p>The model consists of 27 identical copies of a single small <i>cubelet</i> whose sides are colored red, white, blue, yellow, orange and green. Initially, all cubelets have the same orientation. A <i>move</i> is the simultaneous rotation of the nine cubelets in one of the six faces, by 90&deg; or 180&deg;, clockwise or counterclockwise.  This leads to $4.3 \\times 10^{19}$ possible configurations for a scrambled cube.</p><p>The object of the puzzle is to return a scrambled cube to the initial state.  Most people are interested in solving the puzzle rapidly, but I am more interested in the number of moves required.</p><p><tt>Qube</tt> offers animations of many mathematical properties of Rubik's cubes.  Here is a frame from one of them.</p><p><img alt=\"\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Qube_frame.png\" vspace=\"5\" /> </p><h4>Simulink<a name=\"873c693b-1541-41b8-b6c6-583b05562cd0\"></a></h4><p>MATLAB's companion product, Simulink, is a block diagram programming environment used to design and simulate systems with multidomain models and to automatically generate the code required to operate embedded processors.</p><p>Matrices are involved in dozens of different ways by Simulink, but most users rarely see operations at that detailed level. Our Simulink module shows a model of an automobile being driven on a test track and displays the pitch, roll and yaw recorded by the matrix connecting the coordinate system for the automobile to the coordinate system for the track.</p><p><img alt=\"\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Simulink.png\" vspace=\"5\" /> </p><h4>AI and Gorillas<a name=\"e6b8796b-c1b0-4132-9038-5e5cc92f9ec2\"></a></h4><p>This is a personal story about a project in the early stages of development.</p><p>My wife and I first visited gorillas in the Volcano National Park of Rwanda twelve years ago. An American primatologist named Dian Fossey had studied the gorillas between 1966 and her murder by poachers in 1985. Her book <i>Gorillas in the Mist</i> was very popular and was the basis for a critically acclaimed 1988 Hollywood movie starring Sigourney Weaver.</p><p>We have become good friends with the people in the <a href=\"https://www.gorilladoctors.org/\">Gorilla Doctors</a> organization. These African and American veterinarians attend to the health of the roughly 1,000 gorillas in the park.  Most of the gorillas have African names like \"Inkundwa\" and \"Maisha\".  We envision a gorilla facial recognition system that is available on cell phones and tablets so that new guides and doctors can learn the names of their patients.</p><p>Inception-v3 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is widely used for image processing. We have a version of the network pretrained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. This publicly available system knows nothing about gorillas. We must do additional training using photos of our unique subjects.</p><p>This is where matrices are applied.  Training a CNN involves determining the values of thousands of weights and coefficients.  The digital photos, regarded as vectors, and repeatedly multiplied by circulant matrices where each row is a shifted copy of the other rows.  Importantly, a modern CNN also contains some nonlinear layers.</p><p>Here is one photo from a small test collection.  Indundwa appears to have his own selfie stick.</p><p><img alt=\"\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Gorillas.png\" vspace=\"5\" /> </p><h4>Software<a name=\"96f4d47e-9920-4215-bf7d-2bf2a3286ab9\"></a></h4><p>A self-extracting MATLAB source archive of our four apps is available at</p><p><a href=\"https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Apps_mzip.m\">https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Apps_mzip.m</a></p><h4>Thanks<a name=\"29bbbdbc-5d65-4ac3-a74e-1aafe0388a95\"></a></h4><p>Thanks to Jackson Kustell, Josh Bethoney and Heather Gorr from MathWorks and Jan Ramer and Mike Cranfield from Gorilla Doctors.</p><h4>Dedication<a name=\"6116cfa9-4ed1-4e87-b2ed-099f26839a77\"></a></h4><p>We dedicate the Gorillas project to the memory of <a href=\"https://www.marylandzoo.org/news-and-updates/2023/08/mourning-the-loss-of-dr-mike-cranfield\">Mike Cranfield, DMV</a>.
