<h4>Puzzles<a name="b44ef23f-8ee4-4710-970e-758273aef673"></a></h4><p>The Web site <a href="https://www.artofplay.com">Art of Play</a>, from some folks in San Diego, has well over two-hundred puzzles.  Recently, one of their most popular puzzles, <a href="https://www.artofplay.com/collections/packing-puzzles/products/mighty-cheese-travel-puzzle">Mighty Cheese</a>, caught my attention. The idea is to move the slices of plastic cheese around within the frame in order to create a hole large enough to hold the little plastic mouse.  However, when I last checked, Mighty Cheese was sold out. Not wanting to be dissuaded by the unavailability of the puzzle itself, and not knowing the solution, I set out to build a simulator.</p>

But, unlike the T, the geometry of cheese cannot be modelled by simple rectangular patches.  I needed help. Steve Eddins answered my plea and told me about MATLAB's "polyshapes".

<p>When I made more careful measurements on "Cheese_puzzle.png" and had a more accurate model to simulate, it became clear that my precious first solution just wouldn't fit.</p>
<h4>A round peg in a square hole<a name="30e29a25-e0f0-449b-b09c-4ff8ee26a6b8"></a></h4><p>Nobody said that the mouse had to fit neatly into a circular hole with just the right diameter.  Once you realize that you might be looking for a noncircular hole, you are on the way to finding the solution.</p>
<h4>Theta<a name="19fcdc7d-f204-47d7-9e55-221680530003"></a></h4><p>The key to the puzzle's geometry is the purple axes in this picture.

</pre><p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Mighty_Cheese_theta.gif" vspace="5" /> </p>
<h4>Polyshapes<a name="4933cc60-9813-49dd-8f8c-d822d7b9b2d2"></a></h4><p>The mask that I was using for my first solution got me started with polyshapes, but I eventually abandoned it.  It is easy to make a polyshape directly from a list of points around the boundary, like this.</p>
<p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Mighty_Cheese_S3_dots.gif" vspace="5" /> </p>
<h4>The solution<a name="1dcd1993-0fec-49da-87a9-4b75d997227f"></a></h4><p>The three holes in the original cheese slices do not appear to serve any purpose.  So, I have moved them and given them an important role in this simulation. Combine the two triangular slices in the upper left into a single slice. Rotate each of the resulting four slices by an angle of 180-theta = 168.38 degrees about its center.  The four right-angled corners from the central hole go to the corners of the puzzle while the outer corners form a central square just large enough to hold the mouse.</p>
<p>That is really elegant.</p>
<p>Where did this puzzle originate?  What mathematics was involved in its design?</p>

%% Polygons, Polyshapes and Puzzles
% Until recently, I knew nothing about the |polyshape| object in MATLAB.
% Now I can use polyshape to simulate an extraordinary puzzle.

%% Puzzles
% The Web site <https://www.artofplay.com Art of Play>, from some folks in
% San Diego, has well over two-hundred puzzles.  Recently, one of 
% their most popular puzzles,
% <https://www.artofplay.com/collections/packing-puzzles/products/mighty-cheese-travel-puzzle
% Mighty Cheese>, caught my attention.
% The idea is to move the slices of plastic cheese around within the
% frame in order to create a hole large enough to hold the little
% plastic mouse.  However, when I last checked, Mighty Cheese was
% sold out.
% Not wanting to be dissuaded by the unavailability of the puzzle itself,
% and not knowing the solution, I set out to build a simulator.
%
% <<July_22_2022_small.png>>
%

%% Not a T
% I expected Mighty Cheese to be something like the
% <https://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/introducing-cleves-laboratory.html
% T-puzzle> that I enjoyed several years ago.
% But, unlike the T, the geometry of cheese cannot be modelled by simple
% rectangular patches.  I needed help. Steve Eddins answered my plea and 
% told me about MATLAB's "polyshapes". That led to this blog post.

%% A slice of cheese
% A "selfie" of a cheese slice provides an example of a |polyshape|.
% It has curved boundaries and a hole.  The MATLAB documentation for
% <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/polyshape.html
% |polyshape|> says this a _polygon_.
% In my mathematical world, _polygons_ can't have curved boundaries
% or holes.  But, I guess that I am being pedantic.
%
% <<polyshape.png>>

%%
% I began with this photo of the Mighty Cheese puzzle.
%
%   puzzle = imread('Cheese_puzzle.png');
%
% <<puzzle.gif>>
%
% Two lines of code and the |L*a*b| color model find the regions
% in |photo| that look like cheese.
%
%   [L,a,b] = imsplit(rgb2lab(puzzle));
%   mask = a > 30;
%   spy(mask)
%
% <<mask.gif>>
%
% Steve provided a function that turns |mask| into a |polyshape|
% object.
%
%   slice = my_polyshapes(mask);
%
% An overloaded |plot| function then generates the selfie from |slice|.
%
%   sliceplot = plot(slice, ...
%       'facecolor',cheese_yellow, ...
%       'facealpha',1);

%% My first solution
% I didn't use AI or simulated annealing or any other modern technique
% to search for a solution.  I just poked around while I was learning
% about polyshapes and programming my simulator.  It was just me and
% a _real_ mouse.  No, not a _real real_ mouse.  You know the kind I mean. 
%
% <<Cheese.gif>>

%% Is this solution correct?
% I almost made a blog post claiming this is the solution the designers of
% Mighty Cheese must have had in mind. But I wasn't sure.
% My solution made use of the white  space around the outside edges of the

%
% This puzzle is not as easy as it looks.
% In fact, the solution is very hard to find and is very elegant.
% If you want to try to solve it yourself, stop reading this post,
% bookmark this spot, and come back later.

%% My second solution
% As I should have known, this puzzle is no secret to the Internet
% It is available for about $10 at many places and
% YouTube offers several solutions.  But I'm glad that I didn't see any
% of them until a few weeks ago.

% When I made more careful measurements on "Cheese_puzzle.png"
