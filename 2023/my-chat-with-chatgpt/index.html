%% Mixed Reception
% A newer version of ChatGPT than the one I used is

% Most of these early reports were from people whose primary concern

%% Me and AI
% I have been a long-time observer of REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH although not a contributor to REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH
% artificial intelligence research.
%
% * I took AI courses at Stanford from the inventor of 
%   the field, John McCarthy.
%
% * Bill McKeeman and I entered McCarthy's chess program in
%   a _San Francisco Chronicle's_ by-mail chess contest.
%   (The computer did not fair well.)
%
% * I used Joe Weizenbaum's computer program Eliza, 
%   the very first Chat Bot. 
%
% * I was once married to someone with a PhD in AI.
% 
% * Symbolic Math, like MathWorks now does in our Toolbox, and which
%   we used to do with Macsyma and Maple, was once considered AI.
%
% * The wild animal trail cameras project that I did a few years ago with
%   Heather Gorr and Jim Sanderson uses modern machine learning and AI.
