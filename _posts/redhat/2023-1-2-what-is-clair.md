<p><a href="https://github.com/quay/clair">Clair</a><span>&nbsp;</span>is a static analyzer that is used to index the contents of container images and provide vulnerability matching based on what it found. Clair is not only bundled with Red Hat Quay and used by<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://quay.io/">Quay.io</a><span>&nbsp;</span>but also used in various other Red Hat products with adoption increasing in an effort to offer customers a more standardized view of their security issues. As well as being used internally at Red Hat, Clair is used by many external teams and we always have a robust open-source community depending on us and working with us.</p>
