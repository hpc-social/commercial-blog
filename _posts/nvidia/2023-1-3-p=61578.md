<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Autonomous and electric vehicles are making personal transportation safer and more sustainable — as well as more entertaining.</p>

<p>At CES today, NVIDIA <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/geforce-now-streams-aaa-games-to-cars/">announced</a> that the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/">NVIDIA GeForce NOW</a> cloud gaming service will be coming to cars, with no special equipment needed. Hyundai Motor Group, BYD and Polestar — already members of the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/drive">NVIDIA DRIVE</a> ecosystem — are the first automakers working with NVIDIA to deliver <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/gaming-in-car/">GeForce NOW in their vehicles</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#8220;We are excited to offer our customers the best in technology, comfort, design from BYD and now the latest in gaming through NVIDIA GeForce NOW high-performance cloud gaming service,” said Stella Li Vice President of BYD and CEO of BYD America. &#8220;The experience of driving our cars is becoming increasingly sophisticated, entertaining and sustainable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thanks to cloud technology and the mobile internet, vehicle occupants can keep boredom at bay with the ability to enjoy music, movies and now video games in the car. Drivers and front seat passengers can access games while parked or charging, while those in the backseat of vehicles where rear entertainment is enabled can play anytime on the road.</p>

<p>Hyundai Motor Group, which houses the Hyundai, Kia and Genesis brands, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/11/09/hyundai-ai-infotainment-nvidia-drive/">features NVIDIA DRIVE in-vehicle infotainment</a> across its entire lineup.</p>

<p>In March, BYD, the world’s leading manufacturer of new energy vehicles, announced it would build its NEVs on the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/drive/hyperion">NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion</a> platform, starting in the first half of 2023.</p>

<p>Polestar is also using NVIDIA DRIVE for its software-defined architecture, with the upcoming Polestar 3 powered by the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/drive-platform/hardware/">NVIDIA DRIVE Orin</a> system-on-a-chip.</p>

<p>Now, these trailblazing automakers will offer vehicles that are as entertaining as they are intelligent with the addition of GeForce NOW.</p>

<h2><b>1,000+ Games, Anywhere, Anytime</b></h2>
<p>The next generation of vehicles are transforming from fixed function to software-defined. At the same time, cars are becoming more connected, opening up new services that weren’t possible before.</p>

<p>GeForce NOW delivers a full PC-gaming experience to nearly any device, including laptops, mobile devices, smart TVs — and now, personal vehicles. The GeForce NOW client for auto can run on Android- or browser-based in-vehicle infotainment systems, providing an app to easily select and launch favorite games.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-61662" height="357" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BYD_GFN_1280_680-672x357.png" width="672" /></p>

<p>It uses breakthroughs in low-latency cloud-streaming technology for real-time game play powered by GeForce servers in the cloud. GeForce NOW features more than 1,500 titles — over 1,000 playable with a controller — including top-rated games such as <i>A Plague Tale: Requiem, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</i> and <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, from leading stores such as Steam, Epic Games Store, the EA app, Ubisoft and GOG.com.</p>

<p>The service also includes many of the most-played free-to-play games like <i>Fortnite, Lost Ark</i> and <i>Destiny 2</i>.</p>

<h2><b>Experiencing the Future</b></h2>
<p>The ability to stream games to the car is a key component of the future of in-vehicle experiences.</p>

<p>As autonomous-driving technology becomes more prevalent, the interior will play a much larger role in differentiating brand identities. Consumers will focus more on features such as digital assistants, beautiful graphic displays and streaming content as they make vehicle buying decisions.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-61665" height="357" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Polestar_GFN_1280_680-672x357.png" width="672" /></p>

<p>This shift is turning vehicles into living spaces, where passengers can enjoy what’s important to them — whether it be work or play — rather than the stress of driving.</p>

<p>By providing GeForce NOW in their vehicles, Hyundai Motor Group, BYD and Polestar are taking a significant step into this new era of personal transportation.</p>
