<div id="bsf_rt_marker"><p>Six companies with innovative products built using the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/">NVIDIA Jetson</a> edge AI platform will leave CES, one of the world’s largest consumer technology trade shows, as big winners next week.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ces.tech/innovation-awards/honorees.aspx">CES Innovation Awards</a> each year honor outstanding design and engineering in more than two dozen categories of consumer technology products. The companies to be awarded for their Jetson-enabled products at the conference, which runs Jan. 5-8 in Las Vegas, include:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>John Deere</b>: Best of Innovation awardee in the robotics category and honoree in the vehicle tech and advanced mobility category for its fully autonomous tractor. The tractor is capable of using GPS guidance, cameras, sensors and AI to perform essential tasks on the farm without an operator inside the cab.</li>
<li><b>AGRIST</b>: Honoree for its robot that automatically harvests bell peppers. The smart agriculture company will be at CES booth 62201.</li>
<li><b>Skydio</b>: Honoree for its Scout drone, which an operator can fly at a set distance and height using the Skydio Enterprise Controller or the Skydio Beacon while on the move, and without having to manually operate the drone. Skydio, at booth 18541 in Central Hall, is a member of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-au/startups/">NVIDIA Inception</a>, a free, global program for cutting-edge startups.</li>
<li><b>GlüxKind</b>: Honoree for GlüxKind Ella, an AI-powered intelligent baby stroller that offers advanced safety and convenience for busy parents. The NVIDIA Inception member will be at CES booth 61710.</li>
<li><b>Neubility</b>: Honoree for its self-driving delivery robot, Neubie, a cost-effective and sustainable alternative for delivery needs that can help alleviate traffic congestion in urban areas. The NVIDIA Inception member will be at Samsung Electronics C-LAB’s booth 61032 in Venetian Hall.</li>
<li><b>Seoul Robotics</b>: Honoree for its <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/08/16/seoul-robotics-autonomy-through-infrastructure/">Level 5 Control Tower</a>, which can turn standard vehicles into self-driving cars through a mesh network of sensors and computers installed on infrastructure. The NVIDIA Inception member will be at CES booth 5408.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, NVIDIA Inception members and Jetson ecosystem <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/ecosystem?ncid=partn-854158#cid=em16_partn_en-us">partners</a>, including DriveU, Ecotron, Infineon, Leopard Imaging, Orbecc, Quest Global, Slamcore, Telit, VVDN, Zvision and others, will be at CES, with many announcing systems and demonstrating applications based on the Jetson Orin platform.</p>
