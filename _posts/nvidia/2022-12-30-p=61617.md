<p>Stephen Tong, aka Funky Boy, has always loved music and photography. He’s now transferring the skills developed over the years as a music producer — shooting time lapses, creating audio tracks and more — to a new passion of his: 3D content creation.</p>

<p>Tong began creating 3D renders and animations earlier this year, using the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> platform for building and connecting custom 3D pipelines.</p>

<p>Within just a couple months of learning to use Omniverse, Tong created a music video with the platform. The video received honorable mention in the inaugural <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/machinima-contest/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#MadeInMachinima</a> contest last March, which invited participants to remix popular characters from games like <a href="https://joinsquad.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i>Squad</i></a>, <a href="https://www.taleworlds.com/en/Games/Bannerlord" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</i></a> and <a href="https://mw5mercs.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i>MechWarrior Mercenaries 5</i></a> using the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/machinima/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Omniverse Machinima</a> app.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In September, Tong participated in the first-ever <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/code/developer-contest/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Omniverse developer contest</a>, which he considered the perfect way to learn about <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-omniverse-platform" rel="noopener" target="_blank">extending the platform</a> and coding with the popular Python programming language. He submitted three <a href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_extensions/prod_extensions/overview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Omniverse extensions</a> — core building blocks that let anyone create and extend functions of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Omniverse apps</a> — aimed at easing creative workflows like his own.</p>

<h2><b>Ringing in the Season the Omniverse Way</b></h2>
<p>The artist also took part in the <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/get-in-the-holiday-spirit-with-a-fun-winterartchallenge/234411" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#WinterArtChallenge</a> this month from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA Studio</a>, a creative community and platform of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/rtx/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA RTX</a> and AI-accelerated creator apps. Creatives from around the world shared winter-themed art on social media using the hashtag.</p>

<p>Tong said his scene was inspired by cozy settings he often associates with the holidays.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-61622 size-full" height="1080" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/stephent0-funky-boy-ov-x-christmas-01.jpg" width="1920" /></p>

<p>First, the artist used AI to generate a mood board. Once satisfied with the warm, cozy mood, he modeled a winter chalet — complete with a snowman, wreaths and sleigh — using the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0_NZDSqR3Y&amp;list=PLZHnYvH1qtOY0Fst-duW7M6OzphWAZgzX&amp;index=11" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marbles RTX</a> assets, free to use in the Omniverse Launcher, as well as some models from <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/falling-snow-loop-a19b97d7e64548b998eaeb4d8477c24c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sketchfab</a>.</p>

<p>Tong collected the assets in Unreal Engine before rendering the 3D scene using the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/create/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Omniverse Create</a> and Blender apps. The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/usd/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Universal Scene Description (USD)</a> framework allowed him to bring the work from these various applications together.</p>

<p>“USD enables large scenes to be loaded fast and with ease,” he said. “The system of layers makes Omniverse a powerful tool for collaboration and iterations.”</p>

<p>With his festive creativity on a roll, Tong also orchestrated an animated quartet lip-syncing to “Carol of the Bells” using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/audio2face/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Omniverse Audio2Face</a>, an AI app that quickly and easily generates expressive facial animations from just an audio source, as well as the DaVinci Resolve application for video editing.</p>

<p>Watch to keep up the holiday spirit:</p>
