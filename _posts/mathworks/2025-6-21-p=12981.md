<h4>Poster Session<a name="900d99fc-07f7-4a8c-a630-0e6c7f347a8c"></a>
</h4>
<p>The Tuesday evening poster session was a high point of the meeting. Over 50 posters were set up in the Statler Terrace. We mingled, drank beer, ate ice cream and discussed the posters with their authors. I was impressed by the number of young people doing exciting work.</p>

<h4>Quantum Computing<a name="ef80a124-71d5-4978-82d7-cd69347d59c9"></a>
</h4>
<p>A poster by Christine Tobler from MathWorks described the MATLAB Support Package for Quantum Computing. One model of a hypothetical quantum computer involves a state vector of probabilities and multiplication by unitary matrices.</p>

<h4>Householder Prizes<a name="650df2ca-6b59-4e9d-b3b9-f02a4cf2bb10"></a>
</h4>
<p>The Alston S. Householder Prize is awarded to the author of the best dissertation in numerical linear algebra submitted over the previous three years. This time there were two prize-winning submissions described in a special plenary session on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>Alice Cortinovis from the University of Pisa won the prize for a dissertation supervised by Daniel Kressner from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.</p>

<p>
<img alt="" hspace="5" src="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Alice.png" vspace="5" /> </p>

<p>Jorge Garza-Vargas from Caltech and Jess Banks from U. C. Berkeley shared a second prize for a pair of dissertations supervised by Nikhil Srivastava from Berkeley. Jorge gave the talk.</p>

<h4>Excursion<a name="af59e9bd-360d-4e8c-9096-dd5f227784ea"></a>
</h4>
<p>A tradition at the seminars is the Wednesday afternoon excursion. This year we had the choice of a serious hike, an easy walk, a visit to a nearby winery, or a nap at the hotel. The walk was on the Gorge trail in Taughannock Falls State Park and was fabulous.</p>

<h4>Gr&uuml;ezi<a name="928e34bb-faf3-4382-960a-704094ecbfe4"></a>
</h4>
<p>Gr&uuml;ezi is Swiss German for Hello. Anyone planning to attend the Householder seminar in 2028 should learn how to pronounce Gr&uuml;ezi. The seminar will be in Pontresina, Switzerland. Bart Vandereycken made the announcement.</p>

<p>
<img alt="" hspace="5" src="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/Pontresina.png" vspace="5" /> </p>

<p>Pontresina was also the site for the Householder seminar in 1996. The Wednesday excursion at that meeting was a hike down the Morteratsch glacier at Diavolezza.</p>
