<h4>Serra House<a name="efaa301d-ab8b-4786-a901-79639752b152"></a>
</h4>
<p>I first met Nick in 1978 at Stanford's Serra House. Serra House was built in 1923 to be the retirement home for President David Starr Jordan. By the late 1970's it had been assigned to the Computer Science Department and housed the Numerical Analysis group. Professors George Forsythe and Gene Golub had their offices there at one time or another, as did various grad students, post docs, and visitors.</p>

<p>There was a lovely patio, a volleyball court and a real feeling of camaraderie in the Serra House group. In the academic year 1978/79 a particularly strong group of grad studies were working in Serra House. Nick Trefethen was one of them. Marsha Berger, Michael Overton and Randy LeVeque were others.</p>

<p>In 1978/79 Gene Golub was away from Stanford on sabbatical and I took his place for the year. I taught the graduate numerical analysis course and used my new Fortran <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3386331">"matrix laboratory"</a>. It was just a primitive matrix calculator. It was not impressive numerical analysis nor impressive computer science.</p>

<p>Nick and Randy were enrolled in that course and Marsha and Michael sat in sometimes. This was their first exposure to MATLAB. It would have to become a more mature tool before they would find it useful. A few grad students from engineering also took my course and found that primitive MATLAB useful for work in areas like control theory and signal processing, areas that I knew nothing about at the time. That eventually led to Jack Little and to MathWorks.</p>

<p>Nick is a renowned scholar of computational mathematics. His <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen"><i>curriculum vitae</i></a> provides a list of his achievements. He has authored eight books, published hundreds of journal articles and written dozens of essays, He is a fellow of the US National Academy of Engineering and the British Royal Society. He served as president of SIAM and as editor and associate editor for a number of journals.</p>

<p>Here is a sample of a few of his achievements.</p>

<h4>Academic Career<a name="14eff030-ac3a-44d4-8c57-73e16243061f"></a>
</h4>
<p>Nick received his Stanford Ph.D.in 1982. His thesis supervisor was Joe Oliger. From 1982 to 1997 he was on the faculty of NYU, MIT and Cornell.</p>

<p>In 1997, he moved to Oxford University to succeed <a href="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/2017/11/20/leslie-fox/">Leslie Fox</a> as Professor of Numerical Analysis and Fellow of Balliol College. Nick's essay <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/publication/PDF/american.pdf">An American at Oxford</a> is fascinating.</p>

<h4>Wilkinson<a name="2ed8b96e-789b-4712-96d3-b9084674eacb"></a>
</h4>
<p>Nick gave this talk about Jim Wilkinson in 1979.</p>

<h4>100 Digits<a name="b05fdcc4-1f23-4107-bbbc-cf9a6abac0c7"></a>
</h4>
<p>In 2002, Nick specified ten problems, each with a numerical solution. He offered a $100 prize to whoever produced the most accurate solutions, measured up to ten significant digits. Ultimately twenty teams solved all of the problems perfectly. An anonymous donor aided in producing the required prize money. The challenge and its solutions were described in detail by Folkmar Bornemann, Dirk Laurie, Stan Wagon and J&ouml;rg Waldvogel in</p>

<p>
<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9780898717969">The SIAM 100-Digit Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>One of the problems is to find the global minimum of</p>

<p>
<tt>f = @(x,y) exp(sin(50*x)) + sin(60*exp(y)) + sin(70*sin(x)) + sin(sin(80*y)) - sin(10*(x+y)) + (x.^2+y.^2)./4;</tt>
