<h4>Redheffer, Mertens and Ahalt<a name="0c48695a-3a4f-46a2-9d9c-23506fc3aae1"></a>
</h4>
<p>Frequent readers of this blog know about my recent obsession with Redheffer matrices and the Mertens conjecture. So, when my friend Stan Ahalt visited from North Carolina State a few days ago, and wanted to discuss the use of generative AI in the new Data Science curriculum, I suggested asking chatbots to write MATLAB programs that check the Mertens conjecture.</p>

<p>We logged onto the web sites for two different AI companies. Our query was the same at both sites.</p>

<pre>Please write a MATLAB program to test the Mertens conjecture.</pre>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised when both systems knew about MATLAB and understood the query. One of the systems replied:</p>

<pre>Certainly! I'll create a MATLAB program to test the Mertens
conjecture. First, let me briefly explain what the Mertens
conjecture is, and then I'll provide the code.
The Mertens conjecture states that the Mertens function M(n)
is bounded by &radic;n for all positive integers n. Mathematically,
it can be expressed as:</pre>
<pre>|M(n)| &le; &radic;n for all n &gt; 1</pre>
<pre>Where M(n) is the Mertens function, defined as the sum of
the M&ouml;bius function μ(k) for all positive integers k up to n:</pre>
<pre>M(n) = Σ μ(k) for k = 1 to n</pre>
<pre>Here's a MATLAB program to test this conjecture.</pre>
<h4>Program number one<a name="40ba61bb-33a4-43e5-9193-7a3889fb91f5"></a>
</h4>
<p>The program from one of the web sites begins:</p>

<pre>function M = test_Mertens(n)
   % Function to test the Mertens conjecture for a given n
   % Returns true if the conjecture holds for all values up to n, false otherwise</pre>
<p>This is followed by code to sum the M&ouml;bius function and verify that <tt>abs(M) &lt; sqrt(n)</tt>. The crucial <tt>mobius</tt> is a straight-forward implementation of the definition. The code relies on MATLAB intrinsics, <tt>factor</tt> and <tt>unique</tt>.</p>

<pre>function mu = mobius(k)
   % Function to calculate the M&ouml;bius function of k
   % Factorize k
   p = factor(k);
   % Check for square factors
   if length(p) ~= length(unique(p))
      mu = 0;
   else
      mu = (-1)^length(p);
   end
end</pre>
<p>I was very pleased. The entire program is only 40 lines long, eminently readable, and correct.</p>

<h4>Program number two<a name="8d0098c5-f272-4317-8eef-f58166e680af"></a>
</h4>
<p>The program from the other web site is more sophisticated. It knows enough about MATLAB to use its cumulative summation.</p>

<pre>M = cumsum(mu);</pre>
<p>Here is the crucial <tt>mobius</tt> function. At first glance, it looks OK. Is it?</p>

<pre>function mu = mobius(n)
   % Calculate M&ouml;bius function values up to n
   mu = ones(1, n);
   for i = 2:sqrt(n)
      if mu(i) == 1
         for j = i^2:i:n
            if mod(j, i^2) == 0
               mu(j) = 0;
            else
               mu(j) = -mu(j);
            end
         end
      end
   end
end</pre>
<p>As you have guessed, program number two is not correct. Even its own plot reveals that something is amiss.</p>

<h4>Program number three<a name="a1a49807-f649-4010-af50-85a315d67540"></a>
</h4>
<p>Let's return to the second Web site and make a more specific query.</p>

<pre>Please write a MATLAB program that uses Redheffer
matrices to test the Mertens conjecture.</pre>
<p>The resulting program generates a Redheffer matrix with</p>

<pre>R = zeros(n,n);
for i = 1:n
   for j = 1:n
      if mod(i, j) == 0
         R(i, j) = 1;
      end
   end
end</pre>
<p>It computes the determinant to obtain the Mertens value, <tt>M(n)</tt>. It is able to confirm the conjecture for all the <tt>n</tt> in the given range.</p>

<p>What's wrong now? Look at the plot. The computed <tt>M(n)</tt> is always equal to one. Why?</p>

<p>

<h4>Happy Ending<a name="c38da925-a549-4542-bb35-198572a00c66"></a>
</h4>
<p>Program number three can be repaired by adding one line to the code that generates <tt>R</tt>. What is that line? Respond in the comments.</p>

<p>Look at the good side. Instead of just using AI to do homework, we can challenge students to check the results carefully and repair any incorrect programs.</p>
