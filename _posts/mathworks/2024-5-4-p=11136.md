title: R-squared.  Is Bigger Better?
---

<div class="content"><!--introduction-->
<p>The <i>coefficient of determination</i>, R-squared or <tt>R^2</tt>, is a popular statistic that describes how well a regression model fits data. It measures the proportion of variation in data that is predicted by a model. However, that is <i>all</i> that <tt>R^2</tt> measures. It is <i>not</i> appropriate for any other use. For example, it does not support extrapolation beyond the domain of the data. It does not suggest that one model is preferable to another.</p>

<p>I recently watched high school students participate in the final round of a national mathematical modeling competition. The teams' presentations were excellent; they were well-prepared, mathematically sophisticated, and informative. Unfortunately, many of the presentations abused <tt>R^2</tt>. It was used to compare different fits, to justify extrapolation, and to recommend public policy.</p>

<p>This was not the first time that I have seen abuses of <tt>R^2</tt>. As educators and authors of mathematical software, we must do more to expose its limitations. There are dozens of pages and videos on the web describing <tt>R^2</tt>, but few of them warn about possible misuse.</p>

<p>
<tt>R^2</tt> is easily computed. If <tt>y</tt> is a vector of observations, <tt>f</tt> is a fit to the data and <tt>ybar = mean(y)</tt>, then</p>

<pre>   R^2 = 1 - norm(y-f)^2/norm(y-ybar)^2</pre>
<p>If the data are centered, then <tt>ybar = 0</tt> and <tt>R^2</tt> is between zero and one.</p>

<!--/introduction-->
<p>One of my favorite examples is the United States Census. Here is the population, in millions, every ten years since 1900.</p>

<pre>   t         p
  ____    _______
  1900     75.995
  1910     91.972
  1920    105.711
  1930    123.203
  1940    131.669
  1950    150.697
  1960    179.323
  1970    203.212
  1980    226.505
  1990    249.633
  2000    281.422
  2010    308.746
  2020    331.449</pre>
<p>There are 13 observations. So, we can do a least-squares fit by a polynomial of any degree less than 12 and can interpolate by a polynomial of degree 12. Here are four such fits and the corresponding <tt>R^2</tt> values. As the degree increases, so does <tt>R^2</tt>. Interpolation fits the data exactly and earns a perfect core.</p>

<p>Which fit would you choose to predict the population in 2030, or even to estimate the population between census years?</p>
