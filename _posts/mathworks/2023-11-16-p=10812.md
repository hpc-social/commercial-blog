<h4>New Rules<a name="b522fbe2-47f9-4136-a6f2-1892f2cf0495"></a></h4><p>This year's mini hack features short animations. The contest software runs the program you submit to make an animated GIF file with exactly 48 frames and an inner-frame delay time of 1/24 second.  So, your animation will run for two seconds, then continuously repeat. If you want periodic motion, you need to be back where you started by frame 48.</p>
<p>In previous mini hacks, programs had to be Twitter length -- at most 255 characters long. Now, the new limit is 2,000 characters.  Comments and formatting blanks are not counted.  Remixes and reuse of other submissions is encouraged.</p>
<p>Participants and other viewers vote on the submissions.  There are prizes like Amazon gift cards and T-shirts.  MathWorkers may participate, but not win prizes.</p>

<h4>Personal Favorites<a name="3d0c7d73-a1e6-40a1-94ca-11bc9e0705fd"></a></h4><p>I find the results fascinating.  There are so many different creative styles, artistic talents and programming techniques. Here are a few of my personal favorites.</p>
