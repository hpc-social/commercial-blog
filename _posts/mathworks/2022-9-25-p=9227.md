<h4>Puzzle<a name="52520048-f34a-4981-840a-9007a0387f6b"></a></h4><p>Here is the photo of the puzzle "Trio".</p>
<p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/trio_puzzle.png" vspace="5" /> </p>
<p>Here is an English translation of their description.</p>
<p>
<p style="margin-left: 3ex;">
The task of this 2D puzzle is to assemble all the ovals according
to their color into a basic assembly. By moving the balls in the
grooves and turning the center wheel, you can gradually get each
ball where you need it.
</p>

</p>
<p>I am not sure that Clever Toys is still in business. They have not responded to my emails and I have not been able to purchase an actual Trio puzzle.  Of course, that is all the motivation I need to make a MATLAB model.</p>
<h4>Model<a name="2dfd1830-7360-4517-9796-4632c066c884"></a></h4><p>Here is the initial configuration.  There are three fixed outer, partial, discs and one inner, full, disc.  Each of the outer discs has a channel containing 10 marbles.  When the inner disc is positioned properly, the marbles in a channel can be rotated.  Rotating the inner disc itself moves some, but not all, of the marbles, thereby scrambling the colors.</p>
<p>Like Rubik's Cube, the objective of the puzzle is to return to this initial "solved" state.</p>
<p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/trio_initial.gif" vspace="5" /> </p>
<p>Mathematically, both Rubik's Cube and Trio are ultimately based upon rotation matrices.  Rubik's Cube is a 3-D puzzle whose state is specified by the position and orientation of 27 cubelets; this gives Rubik's Cube about <tt>4.3*10^19</tt> possible positions. At each step, there are six faces and 12 possible rotations.</p>
<p>Trio is a 2-D puzzle whose state is specified by the colors of the marbles.  There are 10 marbles of each of three colors; this implies that Trio has <tt>30!/(10!)^3 = 5.6*10^12</tt> possible positions.  At each step, there are eight possible rotations, four discs, clockwise or counter-clockwise.</p>
<h4>Scramble<a name="99075c53-97fe-4397-a096-3baedc01f129"></a></h4><p>A "scramble" is an integer vector with elements between -4 and +4 that specify moves or rotations.  Move 0 initializes the model.  Move <tt>d</tt> with <tt>d</tt> equal to 1, 2, or 3 rotates all the marbles in the <tt>d</tt>-th channel counter-clockwise for one-tenth of a full rotation.  Move <tt>d</tt> with <tt>d</tt> equal to -1, -2, or -3 is the corresponding clockwise rotation. Moves -4 and 4 turn the central disc clockwise or counter-clockwise for one-third of a full rotation.  This rotates some, but not all, of the marbles and mixes the colors.</p>
<p>Here is a scramble of length 29 that provides our example.</p>
<p>D = [ 4 1 3 1 1 -2  3  1  4  4  2  4  4 -3 -3 -2 -3 -3  2  1  4 -1  3 -4  2]</p>
<p>And here is the scrambled result.</p>
<p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/trio_scrambled.gif" vspace="5" /> </p>
<h4>Animation<a name="a45994ba-ec9b-49ab-b897-d0f79de81dcd"></a></h4><p>This animated gif shows the scrambling process one move at a time. The animation does not repeat automatically, so to start it over again, refresh your browser. If it still doesn't move, find another browser.</p>
<p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/trio_scramble.gif" vspace="5" /> </p>
<h4>Unscramble<a name="ff195cfa-9e7f-4693-9c9e-5109eebc19c4"></a></h4><p>Reverse the scramble by running it backwards, changing the sign of each move.  This will return the scrambled position to the initial position. I call this "unscramble"; it solves the scrambled position by a "follow the breadcrumbs" algorithm.</p>
<p>Both animations take a long time to run -- about 80 seconds with my browser.</p>
<p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/trio_unscramble.gif" vspace="5" /> </p>
<h4>Solutions<a name="87972e4e-c85c-4982-8459-add195223548"></a></h4><p>I don't have any idea about how to actually solve a given position without using knowledge of how it was generated, and I don't have any idea about how to quantify the difficulty of finding a solution. This is in sharp contrast to Rubik's Cube where there are measures of difficulty and algorithms for finding optimum solutions.</p>
<h4>Software<a name="2e58ba8b-073a-402d-8259-2f095e0e72d2"></a></h4><p>The program available at <a href="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/trioo.m">this link</a> is interactive.  Click or alt-click in any one of the four discs to make a move in that disc.</p>
