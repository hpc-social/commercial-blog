<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beresford_Parlett">Beresford</a> was born in 1932 in London. He received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from Oxford in 1955.</p>

<p>Beresford came to graduate school at Stanford in 1958. He had very little money and no place to live. At first, he slept in the math faculty women's lounge and showered in the gymnasium. Fortunately, after two quarters, the math made him a teaching assistant, and he was able to move out of the lounge.</p>

<p>I came to Stanford in 1961, three years after Beresford. We were both students of <a href="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/2013/01/07/george-forsythe/">George Forsythe</a>, and are both on the <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/forsythetree.html">Forsythe tree</a>.</p>

<p>Beresford received his Ph.D. in math from Stanford in 1962.</p>

<p>He was a postdoc for two years at NYU's Courant Institute and for one year at the Stevens Institute of Technology</p>

<p>Beresford joined the U. C Berkeley math faculty in 1965 and remained there until his retirement.</p>

<h4>Holy Grail<a name="e8b82c26-30d6-481e-961e-5208e837cc5f"></a>
</h4>
<p>Many researchers, including Parlett, contributed to the search for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail">Holy Grail</a> of matrix eigenvalue computation, an algorithm with O(n) time complexity. The quest culminated in the MRRR algorithm, the subject of the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/Talks/holygrail.pdf">Ph.D. thesis</a> of one of Beresford's students, Inderjit Dhillon.</p>

<p>Beresford's specialities include</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li>Matrix eigenvalues</li>
<li>QR algorithm</li>
<li>Lanczos algorithm</li>
<li>MRRR algorithm</li>
<li>Sparse matrices</li>
