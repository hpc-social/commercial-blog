<h4>Piet Hein<a name="d24e61ac-9d35-47eb-bca6-357702418141"></a></h4><p>Piet Hein (1905-1996) was an extraordinary Danish inventor, mathematician, poet and philosopher.  He invented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_cube">Soma Cube puzzle</a> in 1933.

<p>The Soma Cube puzzle has seven pieces.  One of them is a V-shaped piece made from three cubelets.   The other six pieces are L, T, Z, R, S, and Y with four cubelets each.  That's a total of 27 cubelets, just enough to make a 3-by-3-by-3 cube.  Sound familiar?</p>
