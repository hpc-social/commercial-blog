%% Twenty Years of Parallel MATLAB
% I have just returned from the MathWorks company meeting
% celebrating our 40th Anniversary. In one of the presentations,
% Jos Martin described how Parallel MATLAB was introduced 
% almost twenty years ago.  Here are a few slides
% from Jos's talk.

%% Why There Wasn't Any Parallel MATLAB
% In _MATLAB News and Notes_ for spring 1995, I wrote a one-page
% Cleve's Corner titled "Why there isn't any parallel MATLAB."
% There were three reasons.
%
% * Memory model.  MATLAB would generate a matrix on a host machine,
% split it into roughly equally sized submatrices, and distribute
% each submatrix to a node.  But it took far longer to distribute
% the data then it did to do the computation.  Any matrix that would
% fit into memory on the host was too small to make  effective use
% of the parallel computer itself.
%
% * Granularity.  The amount of work involved in a single matrix 
% computation is too little to be effectively parallelized. 
%
% * Business situation.  There are too few potential customers
% at this time (1995) to undertake fundamental changes in 
% MATLAB's architecture.
% 
% This one-page note turned out to be one of my most widely cited
% publications.
