title: Three Wordle Assistants
---

<div class="content"><!--introduction--><p>When I tackle a Wordle puzzle, I like to make all the key decisions myself.  My three assistants set up puzzles and suggest words when I ask for help, but I guide the actual solution. My assistants also make it possible for me to play Wordle anywhere, anytime, even when my laptop is in airplane mode. I don't need the <i>New York Times</i> or access to the Web.</p>

<h4>Three Assistants<a name="dacb9b49-209b-4bd4-9600-ddcbf92f222e"></a></h4><p><tt>Wordler</tt>, <tt>Words</tt> and <tt>Wordie</tt> are the three assistants. <tt>Wordler</tt> replaces the <i>Times</i> by generating puzzles and evaluating responses. <tt>Words</tt> provides lists of possible responses. <tt>Wordie</tt> handles the Wordler Window and colors the letters gray, green or gold.</p>
<h4>Vocabulary<a name="9a0fa3c8-2ea4-4e0d-8679-69e40f59921c"></a></h4><p><tt>Words</tt> has a <tt>vocabulary</tt> of 4665 five-letter English words. Any of them are acceptable responses. The vocabulary begins with</p>
<pre>  vocab = [ ...
  "ABEAM" "ABETS" "ABHOR" "ABIDE" "ABLED" "ABLER" "ABODE" "ABORT" ...</pre><p>And, 584 lines later, ends with</p>
<pre>  "ZILCH" "ZINCS" "ZINGS" "ZIPPY" "ZOMBI" "ZONAL" "ZONED" "ZONES" ...
  "ZOOMS" ];</pre><p>If you were to print the entire vocabulary with 40 lines per page, you would print over 100 pages of words.</p>
<h4>Words<a name="fef3bbd2-49bf-47e0-b344-69a2b844ce95"></a></h4><p>It took me a long time to write the <tt>Words</tt> assistant, which is called whenever the Words button in the Wordle Window is clicked.</p>
<p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/ratio.gif" vspace="5" /> </p>
<p><tt>Words</tt> is supported by a seventeen-program library of functions named <tt>Wordspq</tt> where <tt>p</tt> and <tt>q</tt> are nonnegative integers with <tt>p+q &lt;= 5</tt>. <tt>Wordspq</tt> finds words with <tt>p</tt> green letters and <tt>q</tt> gold letters. The programs in the <tt>Words</tt> library all have the same structure involving five nested <tt>for</tt> loops.</p>
<p>The last line of <tt>Words</tt> is</p>
<pre>  feval(['Words' p q],Gray,Green,GreenLoc,Gold,GoldLoc)</pre><p><tt>Gray</tt>, <tt>Green</tt> and <tt>Gold</tt> are lists of letters with specified colors and with locations <tt>GreenLoc</tt> and <tt>GoldLoc</tt>.  Locating the green letters is easy because they must be in specific slots. Locating the gold letters is tricky because each of them can be in any of several different slots.</p>
<p>For example, this situation in the NYT puzzle described below would result in a call to <tt>Words13</tt> with</p>
<pre>  Gray = 'AIHEC'
  Green = 'T'
  GreenLoc = 5
  Gold = 'ROU'
  GoldLoc = {[2,3],[3,4],[1,2,4]}</pre><p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/grout3.gif" vspace="5" /> </p>
<h4>Wordle<a name="313da354-b5c6-4675-929e-3bbe89e7a74a"></a></h4><p><tt>Wordle</tt> starts a game by choosing a secret random target from the vocabulary, or from a smaller subset about half the size. At the same time, I choose my starting word, which is usually <tt>RATIO</tt>.  My assistants respond with the Wordler Window and a simple keyboard.</p>
<p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/keybored.png" vspace="5" /> </p>
<p>The gold <tt>O</tt> tells me the target contains an <tt>O</tt>, that it is not in position 5, and the target does not contain <tt>R</tt>, <tt>A</tt>, <tt>T</tt>, or <tt>I</tt>. I know there are hundreds of such words in the vocabulary. One of them is <tt>DEMOS</tt>, which I enter on the keyboard.</p>
<p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/demos.gif" vspace="5" /> </p>
<p><tt>DEMOS</tt> happens to be a very lucky choice.  The target has an <tt>E</tt> in the second slot, an <tt>S</tt> in the last slot, <tt>M</tt> and <tt>O</tt> in the remaining slots, and no <tt>D</tt>. When the answer does not occur to me in a minute or two, I click the <tt>Words</tt> button.  The response is</p>
<pre>  MEOWS
  cnt = 1</pre><p>So, there is only one word to choose, and it earns five greens.</p>
<p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/meows.gif" vspace="5" /> </p>
<h4>NYT<a name="bc74a1cc-f3c3-4b86-bd1b-7a19d18b8d36"></a></h4><p>Let's do the <i>Times</i> puzzle from March 23. I start with my mathematical <tt>RATIO</tt>. I see that the answer contains <tt>R</tt>, <tt>T</tt> and <tt>O</tt> and does not contain <tt>A</tt> or <tt>I</tt>.</p>
<p>I happen to remember that <tt>OTHER</tt> qualifies.  It does not hit any new letters, but it places additional restrictions on the ones I already have and eliminates <tt>E</tt> and <tt>H</tt>.</p>
<p><tt>Words</tt> now lists 37 words that I should choose from.  I pick <tt>COURT</tt> because it contains <tt>U</tt>, the only remaining vowel.</p>
<p><tt>Words</tt> informs me that there are only two possibilities left, <tt>TROUT</tt> and <tt>GROUT</tt>.  I pick the one without a double consonant and it is the winner.</p>
<p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/grout_combo.gif" vspace="5" /> </p>
<h4>Pared Down<a name="a2a62471-6d35-4253-8c11-b0de6725afd4"></a></h4><p>Here is an atypical, but instructive, example.  For this puzzle I am pleased to see <tt>Wordler</tt> gives <tt>RATIO</tt> a green <tt>A</tt> in position 2 and a gold <tt>R</tt> somewhere in positions 3 through 5.  I remember one of my favorite "technical" terms, <tt>PARSE</tt>.</p>
<p>To use a baseball metaphor, <tt>PARSE</tt> hits a triple and almost gets an in-the-park home run.  Now I need to ask <tt>Words</tt> for qualifying responses.  There are exactly two, <tt>PARED</tt> and <tt>PARER</tt>.  (Both come from the verb "to pare", which means to cut the outer skin off something.)</p>
<p>One of the choices has a double consonant, so I choose the other one. When it doesn't fly, the only choice left earns the five-leaf clover.</p>
<p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/parer_combo.gif" vspace="5" /> </p>
<h4>Five Golds<a name="3634c294-6419-4ca0-9339-7a1e50630492"></a></h4><p>How do I generate five golds?  I need the starting guess to be a <i>permutation</i> of the final answer.  A few moments thought suggests <tt>TAKES</tt> and <tt>SKATE</tt>.  I am sure there are other possibilities. But this one is special because <tt>STEAK</tt> makes it triplets. <tt>TEAKS</tt> would make four permutations but does not meet the "hard mode" restrictions.</p>

% I don't need the _New York Times_ or access to the Web.

%% Three Assistants
% |Wordler|, |Words| and |Wordie| are the three assistants.
% |Wordler| replaces the _Times_ by generating puzzles
% and evaluating responses.
% |Words| provides lists of possible responses.
% |Wordie| handles the Wordler Window and colors the letters gray, 
% green or gold.

%% Vocabulary
% |Words| has a |vocabulary| of 4665 five-letter English words.
% Any of them are acceptable responses.
% The vocabulary begins with
% 
%    vocab = [ ...  
%    "ABEAM" "ABETS" "ABHOR" "ABIDE" "ABLED" "ABLER" "ABODE" "ABORT" ...

% you would print over 100 pages of words.

%% Words
% It took me a long time to write the |Words| assistant, which is

%
% The last line of |Words| is
