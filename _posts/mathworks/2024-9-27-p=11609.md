<p>The elements in the first column of the Redheffer matrix, <tt>A = redheffer(n)</tt>, are all equal to one. That dense column does not make MATLAB happy about computing <tt>det(A)</tt> . However, the last column of <tt>A</tt> has only a few nonzero elements and so Pat suggested interchanging the first and last columns before computing the determinant. This makes a world of difference. (Thanks, Pat.)</p>

<p>The time required to compute <tt>det(A)</tt> varies with the sparsity of the last column, but it is only a little more than the time to compute <tt>redheffer(n)</tt> in the first place.</p>
