title: My Chat with Ernie, a Chinese Chat Bot

<div class="content"><!--introduction--><p>I recently had an opportunity to chat with Ernie, the Large Language Model currently under development at the Chinese internet search giant, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/07/baidu-shares-leaps-as-it-reveals-plan-for-chatgpt-style-ernie-bot.html">Baidu</a>.  As I expected, Ernie's responses are in Chinese. I don't speak Chinese, so I have asked Google Translate for the response in English.</p>
