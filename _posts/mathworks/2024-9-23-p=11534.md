<h4>Redheffer's Matrix<a name="82c24739-64fc-4329-b610-b923ff740e51"></a>
</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Redheffer">Raymond Redheffer</a> (1921-2005) was an American mathematician, a professor at UCLA for 55 years, the author of several popular textbooks, the inventor of the electronic game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim">Nim</a> and, with Ray and Charles Eames, the creator of a four-meter long poster <a href="https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/1966-ray-charles-eames-office-men-1724813663">Men of Modern Mathematics</a>.</p>

<p>Redheffer's matrix is a matrix of zeros and ones. <tt>A(k,j)</tt> equals one if <tt>j</tt> is a divisor of <tt>k</tt>. In addition, the first column is all ones.</p>

<pre>  function A = redheffer(n)
      k = 1:n;
      j = k';
      A = (mod(k,j) == 0);
      A(:,1) = 1;
  end</pre>
<p>Or</p>

<pre>  A = gallery('redheff',n)</pre>
<p>Here is the 10-by-10.</p>

</h4>
<p>The M&ouml;bius function was introduced in 1832 by German mathematician August M&ouml;bius and is ubiquitous in the study of prime numbers. For positive integers <tt>n</tt>, <tt>μ(n)</tt> is</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li>
<tt>0</tt> if <tt>n</tt> has a squared prime factor,</li>
<li>
<tt>+1</tt> if <tt>n</tt> is square-free and has an even number of prime factors,</li>
<li>
<tt>-1</tt> if <tt>n</tt> is square-free and has an odd number of prime factors.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>Mertens Function<a name="ebef8c86-e7dd-4ca8-9f35-7da51c2313c4"></a>
</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Mertens">Franz Mertens</a> (1840-1927) was a Polish mathematician who spent most of his career in Austria at the University of Vienna. Here is a <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Mertens/">link</a> to a biography of Mertens at the University of St. Andrews MacTutor project.</p>

<p>The Mertens function is sum of values of the M&ouml;bius function. For a positive integer <tt>n</tt>, the Mertens function is</p>

<pre>   M(n) = sum(μ(1:n))</pre>
<p>So <tt>M(n)</tt> is the difference between the number of square-free integers with an even number of prime factors and those with an odd number.</p>

<p>This graphic shows <tt>M(n)</tt> for <tt>n = 1:100000</tt>.</p>

<pre class="codeinput">
    mertens_plot_2
</pre>
<img alt="" hspace="5" src="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/mertens_blog2_02.png" vspace="5" /> <h4>Mertens Conjecture<a name="36e351c3-4c49-43ab-8776-9f5f5e7011f6"></a>
</h4>
<p>The Mertens function <tt>M(n)</tt> fluctuates wildly and grows slowly with increasing <tt>n</tt>. The graphic shows that M(n) is easily bounded by of <tt>sqrt(n)</tt> and <tt>-sqrt(n)</tt>, at least for <tt>n</tt> less than <tt>100k</tt>. The Mertens conjecture is that this continues for larger <tt>n</tt>.</p>

<pre>  -sqrt(n) &lt; M(n) &lt; sqrt(n) for all n</pre>
<p>The conjecture was included in a letter from Stieltjes to Hermite in 1895 and in a paper by Mertens in 1897. The result is important since a proof of the Mertens conjecture would imply the truth of the Riemann hypothesis.</p>

<h4>Mertens Meets Redheffer<a name="4b56c506-95ad-4d6b-8f23-569f167616b7"></a>
</h4>
<p>I became interested in all this when I learned that the determinant of the MATLAB Gallery matrix which I have ignored for years is related to the Riemann hypothesis and the million-dollar prize.</p>

<pre>  M(n) = det(gallery('redheff',n))</pre>
<p>I know very little about the distribution of prime numbers and computing values of the M&ouml;bius function. On the other hand, I know a lot about numerical linear algebra and computing determinants.</p>

<p>In general, I am dead set against computing determinants. They are often used to check for singularity or to somehow compute eigenvalues. But here the determinant is an integer counter of modest size.</p>

<h4>Redheffer Sparsity<a name="f8ff3cc0-f3e0-4d4d-84f5-b3049b3af76f"></a>
</h4>
<p>Computing <tt>M(n)</tt> directly with <tt>det(redheffer(n))</tt> requires <tt>O(n^2)</tt> space and <tt>O(n^3)</tt> time and is not practical for large <tt>n</tt>.</p>

<p>However, <tt>A = redheffer(n)</tt> is modestly sparse. Here is the fraction of nonzeros.</p>

<pre>  s = nnz(A)/n^2</pre>
<pre class="codeinput">
    disp(sparsity)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
       n         s

    10000    0.001037
    20000    0.000553
    30000    0.000382
    40000    0.000294

    90000    0.000139
    1e+05    0.000127
</pre>
<p>Taking advantage of this sparsity and the MATLAB tools for sparse matrix computation provide linear space complexity and perhaps <tt>O(n^2)</tt> time complexity.</p>

<h4>
<tt>redheffer</tt><a name="3cf9c9a2-aba7-4a78-b8f2-96522c7fc05d"></a>
</h4>
<p>Here is MATLAB code to generate a sparse <tt>redheffer(n)</tt> without creating any full intermediate matrices.</p>

<pre class="codeinput">type<span class="string">    redheffer</span>
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
    function A = redheffer(n)
        j(1:n) = (1:n)';
        k(1:n) = 1;
        m = n;
        for i = 2:n
            t = [1 i:i:n]';
            p = length(t);
            j(m+(1:p)) = t;
            k(m+(1:p)) = i;
            m = m+p;
        end
        A = sparse(k,j,1,n,n);
    end
</pre>
<p>As expected, we see that the execution time for <tt>redheffer(n)</tt> is a linear function of <tt>n</tt>. (The space required also grows linearly.)</p>

<img alt="" hspace="5" src="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/mertens_blog2_03.png" vspace="5" /> <h4>Sparse LU<a name="221d2a42-3916-44d9-b314-debfbcfbaced"></a>
</h4>
<p>The MATLAB Gaussian elimination function <tt>lu</tt> with one sparse input and four sparse outputs is designed for solving sparse linear systems.</p>

<pre>  [L,U,P,Q] = lu(A)</pre>
<p>Written primarily by Tim Davis and included in his UMFPACK package, the function uses an unsymmetric pattern multifrontal pivoting strategy to find permutations <tt>P</tt> and <tt>Q</tt> so that <tt>L</tt> is lower triangular, <tt>U</tt> is upper triangular and</p>

<pre>  P*A*Q = L*U</pre>
<p>Consequently, the determinant of <tt>A</tt> is the product of four easily computed determinants.</p>

<pre>  det(A) = det(L)*det(U)*det(P)*det(Q)</pre>
<p>The pivoting strategy aims to reduce fill-in while maintaining numerical stability.</p>

<p>For example, here are <tt>L</tt> and <tt>U</tt> for the Redheffer matrix in the spy plot near the top of this blog post.</p>

<pre class="codeinput">
    close
    A = redheffer(200);
    [L,U,P,Q] = lu(A);
    spy(L|U)
    title(<span class="string">'L|U'</span>)
</pre>
<img alt="" hspace="5" src="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/mertens_blog2_04.png" vspace="5" /> <p>And here are the four determinants.</p>

<pre class="codeinput">
    dets = [det(L),det(U),det(P),det(Q)];
    disp(dets)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
    1    -8    -1    -1
</pre>
<p>Finally, <tt>M(200)</tt> is</p>

<pre class="codeinput">
    M_200 = det(L)*det(U)*det(P)*det(Q)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
    M_200 =
        -8
</pre>
<h4>
<tt>mertens</tt><a name="c293a71a-bd97-4107-8fc8-3063376e0ea7"></a>
</h4>
<p>Mertens function can be computed with four lines of code.</p>

<pre class="codeinput">
    type<span class="string">    mertens</span>
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
    function M = mertens(n)
        der = @(x) full(round(prod(diag(x))));
        A = redheffer(n);
        [L,U,P,Q] = lu(A);
        M = der(L)*der(U)*det(P)*det(Q);
    end
</pre>
<p>Execution time for <tt>mertens</tt> is dominated by the time in sparse <tt>lu</tt>. The time required to compute the four determinants is an order of magnitude smaller than the other two.</p>

<p>Experimentally, we see that the time complexity of sparse <tt>lu</tt> is <tt>O(n^2)</tt>, but we have no proof.</p>

<img alt="" hspace="5" src="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/files/mertens_blog2_05.png" vspace="5" /> <h4>Mertens Conjecture Is False<a name="5dc1b513-cf9c-43c7-a3b7-06e75d99e97e"></a>
</h4>
<p>The Mertens conjecture stood for nearly 100 years before it was proved false in 1985 by Andrew Odlyzko and Herman te Riele. The authors present indirect proofs that</p>

<pre>  lim sup (n -&gt; inf) M(n)/sqrt(n) &gt; 1.06</pre>
<pre>  lim inf (n -&gt; inf) M(n)/sqrt(n) &lt; -1.009</pre>
<p>Odlyzko and te Riele do not actually produce any value of <tt>n</tt> for which <tt>M(n) &gt; sqrt(x)</tt>. They suspect that any Mertens conjecture counterexample requires <tt>n</tt> &gt; $10^{30}$, which is far beyond any computation possible today.</p>

<p>Odlyzko and te Riele also describe several complete tabulations of <tt>M(n)</tt> for <tt>n</tt> as large as $7.8 \cdot 10^{9}$ . These computations do not use Redheffer determinants.</p>

<h4>Postscripts<a name="4247c5bb-c39a-4a0a-88a9-4859dcc0e793"></a>
</h4>
<p>To tell the truth, I did not really expect to find any Mertens or Riemann counterexamples. I did, however, enjoy computing determinants for the first time and discovering an unexpected use for sparse LU.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot to Tim Davis for his help with this post.</p>

%% Möbius Function
% The Möbius function was introduced in 1832 by German mathematician
% August Möbius and is ubiquitous in the study of prime numbers.
% For positive integers |n|, |μ(n)| is
%
% * |0| if |n| has a squared prime factor,
% * |+1| if |n| is square-free and has an even number of prime factors,
% * |-1| if |n| is square-free and has an odd number of prime factors.
%
%% Mertens Function
% <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Mertens Franz Mertens>
% (1840-1927) was a Polish mathematician who spent most of his
% career in Austria at the University of Vienna.
% Here is a
% <https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Mertens/
% link> to a biography of Mertens at the University of St. Andrews
% MacTutor project.
%
% The Mertens function is sum of values of the Möbius function.
% For a positive integer |n|, the Mertens function is
%
%     M(n) = sum(μ(1:n))
%
% So |M(n)| is the difference between the number of square-free
% integers with an even number of prime factors and those with an
% odd number.
%
% This graphic shows |M(n)| for |n = 1:100000|.

%% Mertens Conjecture
% The Mertens function |M(n)| fluctuates wildly and grows slowly with
% increasing |n|.  The graphic shows that M(n) is easily bounded
% by of |sqrt(n)| and |-sqrt(n)|, at least for |n| less than |100k|.
% The Mertens conjecture is that this continues for larger |n|.
% 
%    -sqrt(n) < M(n) < sqrt(n) for all n
%
% The conjecture was included in a letter from Stieltjes to
% Hermite in 1895 and in a paper by Mertens in 1897.
% The result is important since a proof of the Mertens conjecture
% would imply the truth of the Riemann hypothesis.

%% Mertens Meets Redheffer
% I became interested in all this when I learned that
% the determinant of the MATLAB Gallery matrix which I have
% ignored for years is related to the Riemann hypothesis and
% the million-dollar prize.
%
%    M(n) = det(gallery('redheff',n))
%
% I know very little about the distribution of prime numbers and
% computing values of the Möbius function.  On the other hand,
% I know a lot about numerical linear algebra and computing determinants.
%
% In general, I am dead set against computing determinants.
% They are often used to check for singularity or to somehow
% compute eigenvalues.  But here the determinant is an
% integer counter of modest size.

%% Redheffer Sparsity
% Computing |M(n)| directly with |det(redheffer(n))| requires
% |O(n^2)| space and |O(n^3)| time and is not practical for
% large |n|.
%
% However, |A = redheffer(n)| is modestly sparse.
% Here is the fraction of nonzeros.
% 
%    s = nnz(A)/n^2
     
     disp(sparsity)

%% 
% Taking advantage of this sparsity and the MATLAB tools for
% sparse matrix computation provide
% linear space complexity and perhaps |O(n^2)| time complexity.

%% |redheffer|
% Here is MATLAB code to generate a sparse |redheffer(n)| without
% creating any full intermediate matrices.


    type redheffer

%%
% As expected, we see that the execution time for |redheffer(n)|
% is a linear function of |n|.  (The space required also grows linearly.)

    redheffer_time

%% Sparse LU
% The MATLAB Gaussian elimination function |lu| with one sparse
% input and four sparse outputs
% is designed for solving sparse linear systems.
% 
%    [L,U,P,Q] = lu(A)
%
% Written primarily
% by Tim Davis and included in his UMFPACK package, the function
% uses an unsymmetric pattern multifrontal pivoting strategy to
% find permutations |P| and |Q| so that |L| is lower triangular,
% |U| is upper triangular and
%
%    P*A*Q = L*U
%
% Consequently, the determinant of |A| is the product of four easily
% computed determinants.
%
%    det(A) = det(L)*det(U)*det(P)*det(Q)
%
% The pivoting strategy aims to reduce fill-in while maintaining
% numerical stability.

%%
% For example, here are |L| and |U| for the Redheffer matrix
% in the spy plot near the top of this blog post.

    close
    A = redheffer(200);
    [L,U,P,Q] = lu(A);
    spy(L|U)
    title('L|U')
    
%%
% And here are the four determinants.

    dets = [det(L), det(U), det(P), det(Q)];
    disp(dets)

%%
% Finally, |M(200)| is

    M_200 = det(L)*det(U)*det(P)*det(Q)

%% |mertens|
% Mertens function can be computed with four lines of code.

    type mertens

%%
% Execution time for |mertens| is dominated by the time in sparse |lu|.
% The time required to compute the four determinants is an order of
% magnitude smaller than the other two.  
%
% Experimentally, we see that the time complexity of sparse |lu| is
% |O(n^2)|, but we have no proof.   

    mertens_time

%% Mertens Conjecture Is False
% The Mertens conjecture stood for nearly 100 years before it was 
% proved false in 1985 by Andrew Odlyzko and Herman te Riele.
% The authors present indirect proofs that
%
%    lim sup (n -> inf) M(n)/sqrt(n) > 1.06
%
%    lim inf (n -> inf) M(n)/sqrt(n) < -1.009
%
% Odlyzko and te Riele do not actually produce any value of |n| for 
% which |M(n) > sqrt(x)|. They suspect that any Mertens conjecture
% counterexample requires |n| > $10^{30}$, which is far beyond any
% computation possible today.
%
% Odlyzko and te Riele also describe several complete tabulations of 
% |M(n)| for |n| as large as $7.8 \cdot 10^{9}$ .  These computations
% do not use Redheffer determinants.

%% Postscripts
% To tell the truth, I did not really expect to find any Mertens or
% Riemann counterexamples.  I did, however, enjoy computing determinants
% for the first time and discovering an unexpected use for sparse LU.
