title: WordBot and Words, My Wordle Assistants
---

<div class="content"><!--introduction--><p>I am late joining the Wordle craze. Over a year ago, MATLAB programs for solving Wordle puzzles were described by <a href="https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2022/01/18/building-a-wordle-solver/">Adam Filion</a> as a guest blogger on Loren's blog and by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVTcQtEnOlk">Matt Tearle</a> with a YouTube video. But my programs for Wordle Assistants are different. <tt>WordBot</tt> doesn't try to solve any puzzles and <tt>Words</tt> just supplies lists of possible words. I enjoy providing the solution logic myself.</p>
<p>Here are two examples, taken from recent Wordle puzzles in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html"><i>New York Times</i></a>.</p>

<h4>Wednesday<a name="07e1455b-4718-47a2-93c5-cce24028b05f"></a></h4><p><tt>WordBot</tt> has a list of 4676 possible words, but knows nothing about their probabilities, so I don't ask for any assistance with the opening guess.</p>
<p>I like to use mathematical words whenever possible. I usually start with <tt>RATIO</tt>, which has three vowels and two popular consonants. <tt>RATIO</tt> was a good opening move for the puzzle in the <i>Times</i> on Wednesday. It received a green <tt>R</tt> and a gold <tt>A</tt>. I informed <tt>WordBot</tt> of our good fortune using 2, 1 and 0 to indicate green, gold and gray. My faithful assistant responded by reproducing the first graphic in the  <i>Times</i>.</p>

In this situation with an <tt>R</tt> as the first letter, an <tt>A</tt> somewhere in the last three letters and <tt>T</tt>, <tt>I</tt> and <tt>O</tt> on the gray list, <tt>Words</tt> finds 25 words, starting with <tt>REACH</tt> and ending with <tt>RUMBA</tt>.</p>
<p>The last of those 25 words got my attention.  I decided to try <tt>RUMBA</tt> on my second move. I knew <tt>RUMBA</tt> was unlikely to succeed but would be spectacular if it did.  Sure enough, Wordle didn't want to dance.</p>
