title: Using SSLScan to determine supported cipers
---

<p>SSLScan queries SSL services to determine the ciphers that are supported. This is a very useful tool if you wish to </p>




<p>SSLScan is designed to be easy, lean and fast. The output includes preferred ciphers of the SSL service, and the certificate and is in text and XML formats. </p>




<p>The Project Site and Installation can be found at <a href="https://github.com/rbsec/sslscan">https://github.com/rbsec/sslscan</a></p>




<p>I was checking my Windows Server,</p>
