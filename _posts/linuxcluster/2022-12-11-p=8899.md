<p><em>The High Performance Computing Centre (HPCC) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Singapore employs the latest techniques to ensure good system utilization and a high-performance user experience. The university has a large HPC cluster with the Altair® PBS Professional® workload manager, and the HPCC team installed Altair Mistral<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /> to monitor application I/O and storage performance. In this paper, we describe how they used Mistral to analyze an HPC application. After getting some insights into the application, they profiled it against HPCC’s three storage tiers and gained detailed insights into application I/O patterns and storage performance.</em></p>
